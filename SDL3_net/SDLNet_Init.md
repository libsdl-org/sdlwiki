###### (This function is part of SDL_net, a separate library from SDL.)
# SDLNet_Init

Initialize the SDL_net library.

## Syntax

```c
int SDLNet_Init(void);

```

## Return Value

Returns 0 on success, -1 on error; call SDL_GetError() for details.

## Remarks

This must be successfully called once before (almost) any other SDL_net
function can be used.

It is safe to call this multiple times; the library will only initialize
once, and won't deinitialize until [SDLNet_Quit](SDLNet_Quit.md)() has been
called a matching number of times. Extra attempts to init report success.

## Thread Safety

It is safe to call this function from any thread.

## Version

This function is available since SDL_net 3.0.0.
