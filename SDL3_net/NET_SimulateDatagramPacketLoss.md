# NET_SimulateDatagramPacketLoss

Enable simulated datagram socket failures.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3_net/SDL_net.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_net/blob/main/include/SDL3_net/SDL_net.h)

## Syntax

```c
void NET_SimulateDatagramPacketLoss(NET_DatagramSocket *sock, int percent_loss);
```

## Function Parameters

|                                            |                  |                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [NET_DatagramSocket](NET_DatagramSocket) * | **sock**         | The socket to set a failure rate on.                                     |
| int                                        | **percent_loss** | A number between 0 and 100. Higher means more failures. Zero to disable. |

## Remarks

Often times, testing a networked app on your development machine--which
might have a wired connection to a fast, reliable network service--won't
expose bugs that happen when networks intermittently fail in the real
world, when the wifi is flakey and firewalls get in the way.

This function allows you to tell the library to pretend that some
percentage of datagram socket data transmission will fail.

The library will randomly lose packets (both incoming and outgoing) at an
average matching `percent_loss`. Setting this to zero (the default) will
disable the simulation. Setting to 100 means _everything_ fails
unconditionally and no further data will get through. At what percent the
system merely borders on unusable is left as an exercise to the app
developer.

This is intended for debugging purposes, to simulate real-world conditions
that are various degrees of terrible. You probably should _not_ call this
in production code, where you'll likely see real failures anyhow.

## Thread Safety

It is safe to call this function from any thread.

## Version

This function is available since SDL_Net 3.0.0.
