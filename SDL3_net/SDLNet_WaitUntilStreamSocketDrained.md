# SDLNet_WaitUntilStreamSocketDrained

Block until all of a stream socket's pending data is sent.

## Syntax

```c
int SDLNet_WaitUntilStreamSocketDrained(SDLNet_StreamSocket *sock, Sint32 timeout);

```

## Function Parameters

|                 |                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **sock**        | the stream socket to wait on                                                                                       |
| **timeout**     | Number of milliseconds to wait for draining to complete. -1 to wait indefinitely, 0 to check once without waiting. |

## Return Value

Returns number of bytes still pending transmission, -1 on failure; call
SDL_GetError() for details.

## Remarks

If [SDLNet_WriteToStreamSocket](SDLNet_WriteToStreamSocket.md)() couldn't send
all its data immediately, it will queue it to be sent later. This function
lets the app sleep until all the data is transmitted.

This function takes a timeout value, represented in milliseconds, of how
long to wait for transmission to complete. Specifying a timeout of -1
instructs the library to wait indefinitely, and a timeout of 0 just checks
the current status and returns immediately (and is functionally equivalent
to calling
[SDLNet_GetStreamSocketPendingWrites](SDLNet_GetStreamSocketPendingWrites.md)).

If you don't want your program to block, you can call
[SDLNet_GetStreamSocketPendingWrites](SDLNet_GetStreamSocketPendingWrites.md)
from time to time until you get a result <= 0.

If the connection has failed (remote side dropped us, or one of a million
other networking failures occurred), this function will report failure by
returning -1. Stream sockets only report failure for unrecoverable
conditions; once a stream socket fails, you should assume it is no longer
usable and should destroy it with SDL_DestroyStreamSocket().

## Thread Safety

You should not operate on the same socket from multiple threads at the same
time without supplying a serialization mechanism. However, different
threads may access different sockets at the same time without problems.

## Version

This function is available since SDL_Net 3.0.0.
