= SDL_GLcontextFlag =
An enumeration of OpenGL context configuration flags.




== Values ==
{|
|SDL_GL_CONTEXT_DEBUG_FLAG
|see [[#SDL_GL_CONTEXT_DEBUG_FLAG|Remarks]]
|-
|SDL_GL_CONTEXT_FORWARD_COMPATIBLE_FLAG
|see [[#SDL_GL_CONTEXT_FORWARD_COMPATIBLE_FLAG|Remarks]]
|-
|SDL_GL_CONTEXT_ROBUST_ACCESS_FLAG
|see [[#SDL_GL_CONTEXT_ROBUST_ACCESS_FLAG|Remarks]]
|-
|SDL_GL_CONTEXT_RESET_ISOLATION_FLAG
|see [[#SDL_GL_CONTEXT_RESET_ISOLATION_FLAG|Remarks]]
|}


== Code Examples ==
```c++
SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_CONTEXT_FLAGS, SDL_GL_CONTEXT_DEBUG_FLAG);
```


== Remarks ==
This enumeration is used in conjunction with [[SDL_GL_SetAttribute]] and [[SDL_GLattr|SDL_GL_CONTEXT_FLAGS]].  Multiple flags can be OR'd together.

If you don't know what these values do, you should assume the defaults are already fine and shouldn't use these flags. Not only are they not available on all platforms and GPU drivers, they can also have dramatic consequences for OpenGL functionality and performance, so please research them heavily before putting these flags to use.

=== SDL_GL_CONTEXT_DEBUG_FLAG ===

This flag maps to GLX_CONTEXT_DEBUG_BIT_ARB in the [http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/glx_create_context.txt GLX_ARB_create_context] extension for X11 and WGL_CONTEXT_DEBUG_BIT_ARB in the [http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/wgl_create_context.txt WGL_ARB_create_context] extension for Windows. This flag is currently ignored on other targets that don't support equivalent functionality.

=== SDL_GL_CONTEXT_FORWARD_COMPATIBLE_FLAG ===

This flag maps to GLX_CONTEXT_FORWARD_COMPATIBLE_BIT_ARB in the [http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/glx_create_context.txt GLX_ARB_create_context] extension for X11 and WGL_CONTEXT_FORWARD_COMPATIBLE_BIT_ARB in the [http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/wgl_create_context.txt WGL_ARB_create_context] extension for Windows. This flag is currently ignored on other targets that don't support equivalent functionality.


=== SDL_GL_CONTEXT_ROBUST_ACCESS_FLAG ===

This flag maps to GLX_CONTEXT_ROBUST_ACCESS_BIT_ARB in the [http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/glx_create_context_robustness.txt GLX_ARB_create_context_robustness] extension for X11 and WGL_CONTEXT_ROBUST_ACCESS_BIT_ARB in the [http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/wgl_create_context_robustness.txt WGL_ARB_create_context_robustness] extension for Windows. This flag is currently ignored on other targets that don't support equivalent functionality.


=== SDL_GL_CONTEXT_RESET_ISOLATION_FLAG ===

This flag maps to GLX_CONTEXT_RESET_ISOLATION_BIT_ARB in the [http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/glx_robustness_isolation.txt GLX_ARB_robustness_isolation] extension for X11 and WGL_CONTEXT_RESET_ISOLATION_BIT_ARB in the [http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/wgl_robustness_isolation.txt WGL_ARB_create_context_robustness] extension for Windows. This flag is currently ignored on other targets that don't support equivalent functionality.
