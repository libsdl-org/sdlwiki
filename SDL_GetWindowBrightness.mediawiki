= SDL_GetWindowBrightness =

Get the brightness (gamma multiplier) for a given window's display.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
float SDL_GetWindowBrightness(SDL_Window * window);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''window'''
|the window used to select the display whose brightness will be queried
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns the brightness for the display where 0.0 is completely dark and 1.0
is normal brightness.

== Remarks ==

Despite the name and signature, this method retrieves the brightness of the
entire display, not an individual window. A window is considered to be
owned by the display that contains the window's center pixel. (The index of
this display can be retrieved using [[SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex]]().)

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
