= SDL_LoadBMP =

Load a BMP image from a file path.

== Syntax ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
SDL_Surface* SDL_LoadBMP(const char* file)
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''file'''
|the file containing a BMP image
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns a pointer to a new [[SDL_Surface]] structure or NULL if there was
an error; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

The new surface should be freed with [[SDL_FreeSurface]](). Not doing so will
result in a memory leak.

SDL_LoadBMP is a pre-processor macro defined to call [[SDL_LoadBMP_RW]]() with
an automatically closed file loaded by [[SDL_RWFromFile]]().

=== Code Example ===

<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
const char *image_path = "myimage.bmp";
SDL_Surface *image = SDL_LoadBMP(image_path);

/* Let the user know if the file failed to load */
if (!image) {
    printf("Failed to load image at %s: %s\n", image_path, SDL_GetError());
    return;
}

/* Do something with image here. */

/* Make sure to eventually release the surface resource */
SDL_FreeSurface(image);
</syntaxhighlight>
