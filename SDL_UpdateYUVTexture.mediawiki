= SDL_UpdateYUVTexture =

Update a rectangle within a planar YV12 or IYUV texture with new pixel data.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_UpdateYUVTexture(SDL_Texture * texture,
                         const SDL_Rect * rect,
                         const Uint8 *Yplane, int Ypitch,
                         const Uint8 *Uplane, int Upitch,
                         const Uint8 *Vplane, int Vpitch);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''texture'''
|the texture to update
|-
|'''rect'''
|a pointer to the rectangle of pixels to update, or NULL to update the entire texture
|-
|'''Yplane'''
|the raw pixel data for the Y plane
|-
|'''Ypitch'''
|the number of bytes between rows of pixel data for the Y plane
|-
|'''Uplane'''
|the raw pixel data for the U plane
|-
|'''Upitch'''
|the number of bytes between rows of pixel data for the U plane
|-
|'''Vplane'''
|the raw pixel data for the V plane
|-
|'''Vpitch'''
|the number of bytes between rows of pixel data for the V plane
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success or -1 if the texture is not valid; call
[[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.



== Remarks ==

You can use [[SDL_UpdateTexture]]() as long as your pixel data is a
contiguous block of Y and U/V planes in the proper order, but this function
is available if your pixel data is not contiguous.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.1.
