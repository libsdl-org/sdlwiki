= SDL_GetRGBA =

Get RGBA values from a pixel in the specified format.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_GetRGBA(Uint32 pixel,
                 const SDL_PixelFormat * format,
                 Uint8 * r, Uint8 * g, Uint8 * b,
                 Uint8 * a);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''pixel'''
|a pixel value
|-
|'''format'''
|an [[SDL_PixelFormat]] structure describing the format of the pixel
|-
|'''r'''
|a pointer filled in with the red component
|-
|'''g'''
|a pointer filled in with the green component
|-
|'''b'''
|a pointer filled in with the blue component
|-
|'''a'''
|a pointer filled in with the alpha component
|}

== Remarks ==

This function uses the entire 8-bit [0..255] range when converting color
components from pixel formats with less than 8-bits per RGB component
(e.g., a completely white pixel in 16-bit RGB565 format would return [0xff,
0xff, 0xff] not [0xf8, 0xfc, 0xf8]).

If the surface has no alpha component, the alpha will be returned as 0xff
(100% opaque).

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
