====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! SDL2 is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_GetNumAudioDrivers =

Use this function to get the number of built-in audio drivers.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_GetNumAudioDrivers(void);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Return Value ==

Returns the number of built-in audio drivers.

== Remarks ==

This function returns a hardcoded number. This never returns a negative
value; if there are no drivers compiled into this build of SDL, this
function returns zero. The presence of a driver in this list does not mean
it will function, it just means SDL is capable of interacting with that
interface. For example, a build of SDL might have esound support, but if
there's no esound server available, SDL's esound driver would fail if used.

By default, SDL tries all drivers, in its preferred order, until one is
found to be usable.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.

== Code Examples ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
int i;

for (i = 0; i < SDL_GetNumAudioDrivers(); ++i) {
    printf("Audio driver %d: %s\n", i, SDL_GetAudioDriver(i));
}
</syntaxhighlight>
