= SDL_GetNumAudioDrivers =
Use this function to return the number of built-in audio drivers.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_GetNumAudioDrivers(void)
```

== Return Value ==
Returns the number of built-in audio drivers.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
int i;

for (i = 0; i < SDL_GetNumAudioDrivers(); ++i) {
    printf("Audio driver %d: %s\n", i, SDL_GetAudioDriver(i));
}
```

== Remarks ==
This function returns a hardcoded number. This never returns a negative value; if there are no drivers compiled into this build of SDL, this function returns zero. The presence of a driver in this list does not mean it will function, it just means SDL is capable of interacting with that interface. For example, a build of SDL might have esound support, but if there's no esound server available, SDL's esound driver would fail if used.

By default, SDL tries all drivers, in its preferred order, until one is found to be usable.
