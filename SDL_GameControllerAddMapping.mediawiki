= SDL_GameControllerAddMapping =

Add support for controllers that SDL is unaware of or to cause an existing controller to have a different binding.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_GameControllerAddMapping(const char* mappingString);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''mappingString'''
|the mapping string
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 1 if a new mapping is added, 0 if an existing mapping is updated,
-1 on error; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

The mapping string has the format "GUID,name,mapping", where GUID is the
string value from [[SDL_JoystickGetGUIDString]](), name is the human
readable string for the device and mappings are controller mappings to
joystick ones. Under Windows there is a reserved GUID of "xinput" that
covers all XInput devices. The mapping format for joystick is: {| |bX |a
joystick button, index X |- |hX.Y |hat X with value Y |- |aX |axis X of the
joystick |} Buttons can be used as a controller axes and vice versa.

This string shows an example of a valid mapping for a controller:

</syntaxhighlight>
