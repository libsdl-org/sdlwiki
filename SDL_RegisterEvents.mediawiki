= SDL_RegisterEvents =
Use this function to allocate a set of user-defined events, and return the beginning event number for that set of events.


== Syntax ==
```c++
Uint32 SDL_RegisterEvents(int numevents)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''numevents'''
|the number of events to be allocated
|}

== Return Value ==
The beginning event number, or (Uint32)-1 if there are not enough user-defined events left.

== Code Examples ==
<<Include(SDL_UserEvent, , , from="== Code Examples ==", to="== Remarks ==")>>

== Remarks ==
Calling this function with '''numevents''' <= 0 is an error and will return (Uint32)-1.

Note, (Uint32)-1 means the maximum unsigned 32-bit integer value (or 0xFFFFFFFF), but is clearer to write.

== Version ==
This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
