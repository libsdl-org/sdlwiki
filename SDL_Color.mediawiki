= SDL_Color =
A structure that represents a color.


== Data Fields ==
{|
|Uint8
|'''r'''
|the red component in the range 0-255
|-
|Uint8
|'''g'''
|the green component in the range 0-255
|-
|Uint8
|'''b'''
|the blue component in the range 0-255
|-
|Uint8
|'''a'''
|the alpha component in the range 0-255
|}

== Code Examples ==

== Remarks ==
[[SDL_Color]] and SDL_<code></code>Colour are interchangeable.

If you have RGB color values you would use decimal values in this struct.  
 ''Example'': orange = 255,165,0 so set r=255, g=165, b=0.  
If you have HTML color codes you would use hexidecimal values in this struct.  
 ''Example'': orange = #FFA500 so set r=0xFF, g=0xA5, b=0x00.

[[SDL_Color]] describes a color in a format independent way. You can convert an [[SDL_Color]] to a pixel value for a certain pixel format using [[SDL_MapRGB]]().
