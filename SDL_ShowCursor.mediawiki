|1 to show the cursor, 0 to hide it, -1 to query the current state
|}

```

The cursor starts off displayed but can be turned off.  Passing SDL_ENABLE displays the cursor and passing SDL_DISABLE hides it. 

The current state of the mouse cursor can be queried by passing SDL_QUERY; either SDL_DISABLE or SDL_ENABLE will be returned.
