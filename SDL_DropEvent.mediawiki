[[SDL_DropEvent]] is a member of the [[SDL_Event]] union and is used when an event of type SDL_DROPFILE is reported. You would access it through the event's <code>drop</code> field.

This event is disabled by default.  You can enable it with [[SDL_EventState]]().  

If you enable this event you must free the filename in the event.
