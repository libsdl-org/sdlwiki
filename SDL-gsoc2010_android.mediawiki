This is a scratch pad for the Android Google Summer of Code 2010 project, by Paul Hunkin

The code is available here:
http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL-gsoc2010_android


== Status ==

* Builds against the current (r4) [http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html Android NDK]
* Works enough to get a 'hello world'.
* None of the subsystems are implemented yet

== Documentation ==

TODO

== How to build ==

To build SDL:

* Extract the NDK somewhere
* Currently you must set the correct paths to the NDK in:
* build-scripts/acc.sh 
* build-scripts/ald.sh 
* Makefile.android
* 'make -f Makefile.android' should produce libsdl.a

To build a test program:

acc.sh/ald.sh are wrapper scripts designed to make it easier to compile things with the Android toolchain. So, you can build with <code>acc.sh test.c -o test</code>, the same as you would do with normal gcc.
 
Or in a makefile, use:
* CC=/path/to/sdl/build-scripts/acc.sh 
* LD=/path/to/sdl/build-scripts/ald.sh 

== Notes ==

* Screenshots of the current progress may be available here: [http://home.bieh.net/~paul/sdl/ http://home.bieh.net/~paul/sdl/]
