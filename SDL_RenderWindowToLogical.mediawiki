= SDL_RenderWindowToLogical =

Get logical coordinates of point in renderer when given real coordinates of point in window.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_RenderWindowToLogical(SDL_Renderer * renderer, 
                                    int windowX, int windowY, 
                                    float *logicalX, float *logicalY);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''renderer'''
|the renderer from which the logical coordinates should be calculated
|-
|'''windowX'''
|the real X coordinate in the window
|-
|'''windowY'''
|the real Y coordinate in the window
|-
|'''logicalX'''
|the pointer filled with the logical x coordinate
|-
|'''logicalY'''
|the pointer filled with the logical y coordinate
|}

== Remarks ==

Logical coordinates will differ from real coordinates when render is scaled
and logical renderer size set

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.18.
