====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! SDL2 is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_ClearHints =

Clear all hints.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_ClearHints(void);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

This function is automatically called during [[SDL_Quit]](), and deletes
all callbacks without calling them and frees all memory associated with
hints. If you're calling this from application code you probably want to
call [[SDL_ResetHints]]() instead.

This function will be removed from the API the next time we rev the ABI.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.

== Related Functions ==
