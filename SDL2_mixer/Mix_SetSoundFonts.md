# Mix_SetSoundFonts

Set SoundFonts paths to use by supported MIDI backends.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL_mixer.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_mixer.h)

## Syntax

```c
int Mix_SetSoundFonts(const char *paths);
```

## Function Parameters

|              |           |                                                                                  |
| ------------ | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| const char * | **paths** | Paths on the filesystem where SoundFonts are available, separated by semicolons. |

## Return Value

(int) Returns 1 if successful, 0 on error (out of memory).

## Remarks

You may specify multiple paths in a single string by separating them with
semicolons; they will be searched in the _reverse_ order listed (last one
listed will be the first one searched).

This function replaces any previously-specified paths.

Passing a NULL path will remove any previously-specified paths.

Note that unlike most SDL and SDL_mixer functions, this function returns
zero if there's an error, not on success. We apologize for the API design
inconsistency here.

## Version

This function is available since SDL_mixer 2.0.0.
