# Mix_FadeOutChannel

Halt a channel after fading it out for a specified time.

## Syntax

```c
int Mix_FadeOutChannel(int which, int ms);

```

## Function Parameters

|               |                                                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **which**     | the channel to fade out.                                   |
| **ms**        | number of milliseconds to fade before halting the channel. |

## Return Value

Returns the number of channels scheduled to fade.

## Remarks

This will begin a channel fading from its current volume to silence over
`ms` milliseconds. After that time, the channel is halted.

Any halted channels will have any currently-registered effects
deregistered, and will call any callback specified by
[Mix_ChannelFinished](Mix_ChannelFinished.md)() once the halt occurs.

A fading channel will change it's volume progressively, as if
[Mix_Volume](Mix_Volume.md)() was called on it (which is to say: you probably
shouldn't call [Mix_Volume](Mix_Volume.md)() on a fading channel).

Note that this function does not block for the number of milliseconds
requested; it just schedules the chunk to fade and notes the time for the
mixer to manage later, and returns immediately.

## Version

This function is available since SDL_mixer 2.0.0.
