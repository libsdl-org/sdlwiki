# Mix_FadeOutMusic

Halt the music stream after fading it out for a specified time.

## Syntax

```c
int Mix_FadeOutMusic(int ms);

```

## Function Parameters

|            |                                                            |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ms**     | number of milliseconds to fade before halting the channel. |

## Return Value

Returns non-zero if music was scheduled to fade, zero otherwise. If no
music is currently playing, this returns zero.

## Remarks

This will begin the music fading from its current volume to silence over
`ms` milliseconds. After that time, the music is halted.

Any halted music will call any callback specified by
[Mix_HookMusicFinished](Mix_HookMusicFinished.md)() once the halt occurs.

Fading music will change it's volume progressively, as if
[Mix_VolumeMusic](Mix_VolumeMusic.md)() was called on it (which is to say: you
probably shouldn't call [Mix_VolumeMusic](Mix_VolumeMusic.md)() on a fading
channel).

Note that this function does not block for the number of milliseconds
requested; it just schedules the music to fade and notes the time for the
mixer to manage later, and returns immediately.

## Version

This function is available since SDL_mixer 2.0.0.
