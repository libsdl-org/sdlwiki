====== (This function is part of SDL_ttf, a separate library from SDL.) ======
= TTF_RenderUNICODE_Shaded =

Render UCS-2 text at high quality to a new 8-bit surface.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
SDL_Surface * TTF_RenderUNICODE_Shaded(TTF_Font *font,
                const Uint16 *text, SDL_Color fg, SDL_Color bg);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''font'''
|the font to render with.
|-
|'''text'''
|text to render, in UCS-2 encoding.
|-
|'''fg'''
|the foreground color for the text.
|-
|'''bg'''
|the background color for the text.
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns a new 8-bit, palettized surface, or NULL if there was an error.

== Remarks ==

This function will allocate a new 8-bit, palettized surface. The surface's
0 pixel will be the specified background color, while other pixels have
varying degrees of the foreground color. This function returns the new
surface, or NULL if there was an error.

This will not word-wrap the string; you'll get a surface with a single line
of text, as long as the string requires. You can use
[[TTF_RenderUNICODE_Shaded_Wrapped]]() instead if you need to wrap the
output to multiple lines.

This will not wrap on newline characters.

Please note that this function is named "Unicode" but currently expects
UCS-2 encoding (16 bits per codepoint). This does not give you access to
large Unicode values, such as emoji glyphs. These codepoints are accessible
through the UTF-8 version of this function.

You can render at other quality levels with [[TTF_RenderUNICODE_Solid]],
[[TTF_RenderUNICODE_Blended]], and [[TTF_RenderUNICODE_LCD]].

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL_ttf 2.0.12.
