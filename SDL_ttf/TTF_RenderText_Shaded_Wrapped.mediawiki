====== (This function is part of SDL_ttf, a separate library from SDL.) ======
= TTF_RenderText_Shaded_Wrapped =

Render word-wrapped Latin1 text at high quality to a new 8-bit surface.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
SDL_Surface * TTF_RenderText_Shaded_Wrapped(TTF_Font *font,
                const char *text, SDL_Color fg, SDL_Color bg, Uint32 wrapLength);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''font'''
|the font to render with.
|-
|'''text'''
|text to render, in Latin1 encoding.
|-
|'''fg'''
|the foreground color for the text.
|-
|'''bg'''
|the background color for the text.
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns a new 8-bit, palettized surface, or NULL if there was an error.

== Remarks ==

This function will allocate a new 8-bit, palettized surface. The surface's
0 pixel will be the specified background color, while other pixels have
varying degrees of the foreground color. This function returns the new
surface, or NULL if there was an error.

Text is wrapped to multiple lines on line endings and on word boundaries if
it extends beyond <code>wrapLength</code> in pixels.

If wrapLength is 0, this function will only wrap on newline characters.

You almost certainly want [[TTF_RenderUTF8_Shaded_Wrapped]]() unless you're
sure you have a 1-byte Latin1 encoding. US ASCII characters will work with
either function, but most other Unicode characters packed into a
<code>const char *</code> will need UTF-8.

You can render at other quality levels with
[[TTF_RenderText_Solid_Wrapped]], [[TTF_RenderText_Blended_Wrapped]], and
[[TTF_RenderText_LCD_Wrapped]].

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL_ttf 2.0.18.
