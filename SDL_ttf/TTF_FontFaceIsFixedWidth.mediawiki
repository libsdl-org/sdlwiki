====== (This function is part of SDL_ttf, a separate library from SDL.) ======
= TTF_FontFaceIsFixedWidth =

Query whether a font is fixed-width.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int TTF_FontFaceIsFixedWidth(const TTF_Font *font);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''font'''
|the font to query.
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns non-zero if fixed-width, zero if not.

== Remarks ==

A "fixed-width" font means all glyphs are the same width across; a
lowercase 'i' will be the same size across as a capital 'W', for example.
This is common for terminals and text editors, and other apps that treat
text as a grid. Most other things (WYSIWYG word processors, web pages, etc)
are more likely to not be fixed-width in most cases.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL_ttf 2.0.0.
