====== (This function is part of SDL_ttf, a separate library from SDL.) ======
= TTF_RenderUNICODE_Shaded_Wrapped =

Render word-wrapped UCS-2 text at high quality to a new 8-bit surface.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
SDL_Surface * TTF_RenderUNICODE_Shaded_Wrapped(TTF_Font *font,
                const Uint16 *text, SDL_Color fg, SDL_Color bg, Uint32 wrapLength);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''font'''
|the font to render with.
|-
|'''text'''
|text to render, in UCS-2 encoding.
|-
|'''fg'''
|the foreground color for the text.
|-
|'''bg'''
|the background color for the text.
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns a new 8-bit, palettized surface, or NULL if there was an error.

== Remarks ==

This function will allocate a new 8-bit, palettized surface. The surface's
0 pixel will be the specified background color, while other pixels have
varying degrees of the foreground color. This function returns the new
surface, or NULL if there was an error.

Text is wrapped to multiple lines on line endings and on word boundaries if
it extends beyond <code>wrapLength</code> in pixels.

If wrapLength is 0, this function will only wrap on newline characters.

Please note that this function is named "Unicode" but currently expects
UCS-2 encoding (16 bits per codepoint). This does not give you access to
large Unicode values, such as emoji glyphs. These codepoints are accessible
through the UTF-8 version of this function.

You can render at other quality levels with
[[TTF_RenderUNICODE_Solid_Wrapped]], [[TTF_RenderUNICODE_Blended_Wrapped]],
and [[TTF_RenderUNICODE_LCD_Wrapped]].

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL_ttf 2.0.18.
