= SDL_SetColorKey =

Set the color key (transparent pixel) in a surface. E.g. Set cyan pixals to transparent

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_SetColorKey(SDL_Surface * surface,
                    int flag, Uint32 key);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''surface'''
|the [[SDL_Surface]] structure to update
|-
|'''flag'''
|[[SDL_TRUE]] to enable color key, [[SDL_FALSE]] to disable color key
|-
|'''key'''
|the transparent pixel
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

The color key defines a pixel value that will be treated as transparent in
a blit. It is a pixel of the format used by the surface, as generated by
[[SDL_MapRGB]]().

RLE acceleration can substantially speed up blitting of images with large
horizontal runs of transparent pixels. See [[SDL_SetSurfaceRLE]]() for
details.
