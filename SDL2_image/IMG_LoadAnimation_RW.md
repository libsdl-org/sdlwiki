# IMG_LoadAnimation_RW

Load an animation from an SDL_RWops.

## Syntax

```c
IMG_Animation * IMG_LoadAnimation_RW(SDL_RWops *src, int freesrc);

```

## Function Parameters

|                 |                                                                               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **src**         | an SDL_RWops that data will be read from.                                     |
| **freesrc**     | non-zero to close/free the SDL_RWops before returning, zero to leave it open. |

## Return Value

Returns a new [IMG_Animation](IMG_Animation.md), or NULL on error.

## Remarks

If `freesrc` is non-zero, the RWops will be closed before returning,
whether this function succeeds or not. SDL_image reads everything it needs
from the RWops during this call in any case.

When done with the returned animation, the app should dispose of it with a
call to [IMG_FreeAnimation](IMG_FreeAnimation.md)().

## Version

This function is available since SDL_image 2.6.0.
