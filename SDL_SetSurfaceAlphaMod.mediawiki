= SDL_SetSurfaceAlphaMod =
Use this function to set an additional alpha value used in blit operations.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_SetSurfaceAlphaMod(SDL_Surface* surface,
                           Uint8        alpha)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''surface'''
|the [[SDL_Surface]] structure to update
|-
|'''alpha'''
|the alpha value multiplied into blit operations
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
When this surface is blitted, during the blit operation the source alpha value is modulated by this alpha value according to the following formula:
:<code>srcA = srcA * (alpha / 255)</code>
