= SDL_ResetAssertionReport =
Use this function to clear the list of all assertion failures.


== Syntax ==
```c++
void SDL_ResetAssertionReport(void)
```

== Code Examples ==
```c++
SDL_assert(1+1 == 3);  // trigger an assertion.
printf("%p\n", SDL_GetAssertionReport());  // not NULL.
SDL_ResetAssertionReport();
printf("%p\n", SDL_GetAssertionReport());  // NULL.
```

== Remarks ==
This function will clear the list of all assertions triggered up to that point. Immediately following this call, [[SDL_GetAssertionReport]] will return no items. In addition, any previously-triggered assertions will be reset to a trigger_count of zero, and their always_ignore state will be false.
