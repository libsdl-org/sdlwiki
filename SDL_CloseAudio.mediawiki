= SDL_CloseAudio =
This function is a legacy means of closing the audio device. New programs might want to use [[SDL_CloseAudioDevice]]() instead.


== Syntax ==
```c++
void SDL_CloseAudio(void)
```

== Code Examples ==
```c++
extern SDL_AudioSpec want;
if (SDL_OpenAudio(&want, NULL) == 0) {
    SDL_PauseAudio(0);
    SDL_Delay(5000);  // let audio callback run for 5 seconds.
    SDL_CloseAudio();
}
```

== Remarks ==
This function is equivalent to calling

```c++
SDL_CloseAudioDevice(1);
```

and is only useful if you used the legacy [[SDL_OpenAudio]]() function.
