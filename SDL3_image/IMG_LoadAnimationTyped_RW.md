# IMG_LoadAnimationTyped_RW

Load an animation from an SDL datasource

## Syntax

```c
IMG_Animation * IMG_LoadAnimationTyped_RW(SDL_RWops *src, SDL_bool freesrc, const char *type);

```

## Function Parameters

|                 |                                                                               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **src**         | an SDL_RWops that data will be read from.                                     |
| **freesrc**     | non-zero to close/free the SDL_RWops before returning, zero to leave it open. |
| **type**        | a filename extension that represent this data ("GIF", etc).                   |

## Return Value

Returns a new [IMG_Animation](IMG_Animation.md), or NULL on error.

## Remarks

Even though this function accepts a file type, SDL_image may still try
other decoders that are capable of detecting file type from the contents of
the image data, but may rely on the caller-provided type string for formats
that it cannot autodetect. If `type` is NULL, SDL_image will rely solely on
its ability to guess the format.

If `freesrc` is non-zero, the RWops will be closed before returning,
whether this function succeeds or not. SDL_image reads everything it needs
from the RWops during this call in any case.

When done with the returned animation, the app should dispose of it with a
call to [IMG_FreeAnimation](IMG_FreeAnimation.md)().

## Version

This function is available since SDL_image 3.0.0.
