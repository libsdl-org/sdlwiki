# IMG_LoadTextureTyped_IO

Load an image from an SDL data source into a GPU texture.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3_image/SDL_image.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image/blob/main/include/SDL3_image/SDL_image.h)

## Syntax

```c
SDL_Texture * IMG_LoadTextureTyped_IO(SDL_Renderer *renderer, SDL_IOStream *src, bool closeio, const char *type);
```

## Function Parameters

|                |              |                                                                               |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SDL_Renderer * | **renderer** | the SDL_Renderer to use to create the GPU texture.                            |
| SDL_IOStream * | **src**      | an SDL_IOStream that data will be read from.                                  |
| bool           | **closeio**  | true to close/free the SDL_IOStream before returning, false to leave it open. |
| const char *   | **type**     | a filename extension that represent this data ("BMP", "GIF", "PNG", etc).     |

## Return Value

(SDL_Texture *) Returns a new texture, or NULL on error.

## Remarks

An SDL_Texture represents an image in GPU memory, usable by SDL's 2D Render
API. This can be significantly more efficient than using a CPU-bound
SDL_Surface if you don't need to manipulate the image directly after
loading it.

If the loaded image has transparency or a colorkey, a texture with an alpha
channel will be created. Otherwise, SDL_image will attempt to create an
SDL_Texture in the most format that most reasonably represents the image
data (but in many cases, this will just end up being 32-bit RGB or 32-bit
RGBA).

If `closeio` is true, `src` will be closed before returning, whether this
function succeeds or not. SDL_image reads everything it needs from `src`
during this call in any case.

Even though this function accepts a file type, SDL_image may still try
other decoders that are capable of detecting file type from the contents of
the image data, but may rely on the caller-provided type string for formats
that it cannot autodetect. If `type` is NULL, SDL_image will rely solely on
its ability to guess the format.

There is a separate function to read files from disk without having to deal
with SDL_IOStream: `IMG_LoadTexture("filename.jpg")` will call this
function and manage those details for you, determining the file type from
the filename's extension.

There is also [IMG_LoadTexture_IO](IMG_LoadTexture_IO)(), which is
equivalent to this function except that it will rely on SDL_image to
determine what type of data it is loading, much like passing a NULL for
type.

If you would rather decode an image to an SDL_Surface (a buffer of pixels
in CPU memory), call [IMG_LoadTyped_IO](IMG_LoadTyped_IO)() instead.

When done with the returned texture, the app should dispose of it with a
call to SDL_DestroyTexture().

## Version

This function is available since SDL_image 3.0.0.
