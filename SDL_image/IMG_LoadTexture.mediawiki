====== (This function is part of SDL_image, a separate library from SDL.) ======
= IMG_LoadTexture =

Load an image from a filesystem path into a GPU texture.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
SDL_Texture * IMG_LoadTexture(SDL_Renderer *renderer, const char *file);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''renderer'''
|the SDL_Renderer to use to create the GPU texture.
|-
|'''file'''
|a path on the filesystem to load an image from.
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns a new texture, or NULL on error.

== Remarks ==

An SDL_Texture represents an image in GPU memory, usable by SDL's 2D Render
API. This can be significantly more efficient than using a CPU-bound
SDL_Surface if you don't need to manipulate the image directly after
loading it.

If the loaded image has transparency or a colorkey, a texture with an alpha
channel will be created. Otherwise, SDL_image will attempt to create an
SDL_Texture in the most format that most reasonably represents the image
data (but in many cases, this will just end up being 32-bit RGB or 32-bit
RGBA).

There is a separate function to read files from an SDL_RWops, if you need
an i/o abstraction to provide data from anywhere instead of a simple
filesystem read; that function is [[IMG_LoadTexture_RW]]().

If you would rather decode an image to an SDL_Surface (a buffer of pixels
in CPU memory), call [[IMG_Load]]() instead.

When done with the returned texture, the app should dispose of it with a
call to SDL_DestroyTexture().

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL_image 2.0.0.
