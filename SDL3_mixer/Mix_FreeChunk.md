[Mix_Chunk](Mix_Chunk.md) and wants to dispose of its resources.

SDL_mixer will stop any channels this chunk is currently playing on. This
will deregister all effects on those channels and call any callback
specified by [Mix_ChannelFinished](Mix_ChannelFinished.md)() for each removed
channel.

## Version

This function is available since SDL_mixer 3.0.0.
