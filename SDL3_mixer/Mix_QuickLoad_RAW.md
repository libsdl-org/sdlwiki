| **len**     | length of buffer pointed to by `mem`, in bytes. |

## Return Value

function will not attempt to convert it, or even verify it's in the right
format.

If this function is successful, the provided memory buffer must remain
available until [Mix_FreeChunk](Mix_FreeChunk.md)() is called on the returned
chunk.

## Version
