###### (This function is part of SDL_mixer, a separate library from SDL.)
# Mix_Linked_Version

Query the version of SDL_mixer that the program is linked against.

## Syntax

```c
const SDL_version * Mix_Linked_Version(void);

```

## Return Value

Returns a pointer to the version information.

## Remarks

This function gets the version of the dynamically linked SDL_mixer library.
This is separate from the SDL_MIXER_VERSION() macro, which tells you what
version of the SDL_mixer headers you compiled against.

This returns static internal data; do not free or modify it!

## Version

This function is available since SDL_mixer 3.0.0.
