# Mix_GetSynchroValue

This function does nothing, do not use.

## Syntax

```c
int Mix_GetSynchroValue(void);

```

## Return Value

Returns -1.

## Remarks

This was probably meant to expose a feature, but no codecs support it, so
it only remains for binary compatibility.

Calling this function is a legal no-op that returns -1.

## Version

This function is available since SDL_mixer 3.0.0.
