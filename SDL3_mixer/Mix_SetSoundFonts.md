###### (This function is part of SDL_mixer, a separate library from SDL.)
# Mix_SetSoundFonts

Set SoundFonts paths to use by supported MIDI backends.

## Syntax

```c
int Mix_SetSoundFonts(const char *paths);

```

## Function Parameters

|               |                                                                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **paths**     | Paths on the filesystem where SoundFonts are available, separated by semicolons. |

## Return Value

Returns 1 if successful, 0 on error (out of memory).

## Remarks

You may specify multiple paths in a single string by separating them with
semicolons; they will be searched in the order listed.

This function replaces any previously-specified paths.

Passing a NULL path will remove any previously-specified paths.

Note that unlike most SDL and SDL_mixer functions, this function returns
zero if there's an error, not on success. We apologize for the API design
inconsistency here.

## Version

This function is available since SDL_mixer 3.0.0.
