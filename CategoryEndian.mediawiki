= Byte Order and Byte Swapping =

'''Include File(s):'''  [http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/file/default/include/SDL_endian.h SDL_endian.h]


== Introduction ==
This category contains functions for handling endian-specific values.

Endianness comes in two forms - big and little.  
* SDL_LIL_ENDIAN means byte order is 1234, where the smaller (little) numbered position comes first
* SDL_BIG_ENDIAN means byte order is 4321, where the larger (big) numbered position comes first

: ''Example:''  Imagine the hexadecimal sequence in byte form of ```DE AD BE EF```

  When the bytes are read as a little-endian value, the bytes are read lowest byte first, producing the value:
   ```0xEFBEADDE```

  When the bytes are read as a big-endian value, the bytes are read highest byte first, producing the value:
   ```0xDEADBEEF```

SDL_BYTEORDER is a macro that corresponds to the byte order used by the processor type it was compiled for.
* SDL_BYTEORDER is SDL_LIL_ENDIAN for x86, x64, and similar systems that use the little endian byte order.
* SDL_BYTEORDER is SDL_BIG_ENDIAN for PowerPC and similar systems that use the big endian byte order.
