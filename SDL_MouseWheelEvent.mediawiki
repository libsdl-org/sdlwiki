= SDL_MouseWheelEvent =
A structure that contains mouse wheel event information.


== Data Fields ==
{|

|'''timestamp'''
|timestamp of the event
|-
|Uint32
|'''windowID'''
|the window with mouse focus, if any
|-
|Uint32
|'''which'''
|the mouse instance id, or SDL_TOUCH_MOUSEID; see [[#Remarks|Remarks]] for details
|-
|Sint32
|'''x'''
|the amount scrolled horizontally
|-

== Remarks ==
[[SDL_MouseWheelEvent]] is a member of the [[SDL_Event]] union and is used when an event of type SDL_MOUSEWHEEL is reported.  You would access it through the event's <code>wheel</code> field.

An SDL_MOUSEWHEEL event occurs whenever a user moves the mouse wheel.

Movements to the right generate negative '''x''' values and to the left generate positive '''x''' values.  Movements down (scroll backward) generate negative '''y''' values and up (scroll forward) generate positive '''y''' values.

'''which''' may be SDL_TOUCH_MOUSEID, for events that were generated by a touch input device, and not a real mouse. You might want to ignore such events, if your application already handles [[SDL_TouchFingerEvent]].
