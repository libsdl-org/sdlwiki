= SDL_RWFromMem =

Use this function to prepare a read-write memory buffer for use with [[SDL_RWops]].

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
SDL_RWops* SDL_RWFromMem(void *mem, int size);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''mem'''
|a pointer to a buffer to feed an [[SDL_RWops]] stream
|-
|'''size'''
|the buffer size, in bytes
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns a pointer to a new [[SDL_RWops]] structure, or NULL if it fails;
call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

This function sets up an [[SDL_RWops]] struct based on a memory area of a
certain size, for both read and write access.

This memory buffer is not copied by the RWops; the pointer you provide must
remain valid until you close the stream. Closing the stream will not free
the original buffer.

If you need to make sure the RWops never writes to the memory buffer, you
should use [[SDL_RWFromConstMem]]() with a read-only buffer of memory
instead.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.

== Code Examples ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
char bitmap[310000];
SDL_RWops *rw = SDL_RWFromMem(bitmap, sizeof(bitmap));
SDL_SaveBMP_RW(screen, rw, 1);  /* closes SDL_RWops, leaves us memory buffer of data */
</syntaxhighlight>
