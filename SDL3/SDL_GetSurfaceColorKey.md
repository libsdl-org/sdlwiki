# SDL_GetSurfaceColorKey

Get the color key (transparent pixel) for a surface.

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_GetSurfaceColorKey(SDL_Surface *surface,
                    Uint32 *key);

```

## Function Parameters

|                 |                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **surface**     | the [SDL_Surface](SDL_Surface.md) structure to query |
| **key**         | a pointer filled in with the transparent pixel    |

## Return Value

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError.md)() for more information.

## Remarks

The color key is a pixel of the format used by the surface, as generated by
[SDL_MapRGB](SDL_MapRGB.md)().

If the surface doesn't have color key enabled this function returns -1.

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
