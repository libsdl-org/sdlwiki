# SDL_GetSurfaceColorKey

```c
int SDL_GetSurfaceColorKey(SDL_Surface *surface, Uint32 *key);

| **surface**     | the [SDL_Surface](SDL_Surface) structure to query |
| **key**         | a pointer filled in with the transparent pixel    |

## Return Value

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
