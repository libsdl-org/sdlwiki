## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_gamepad.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_gamepad.h)

## Syntax

```c
typedef enum SDL_GamepadType
{
    SDL_GAMEPAD_TYPE_UNKNOWN = 0,
    SDL_GAMEPAD_TYPE_STANDARD,
    SDL_GAMEPAD_TYPE_XBOX360,
    SDL_GAMEPAD_TYPE_XBOXONE,

    SDL_GAMEPAD_TYPE_NINTENDO_SWITCH_JOYCON_PAIR,
    SDL_GAMEPAD_TYPE_GAMECUBE,
    SDL_GAMEPAD_TYPE_COUNT
} SDL_GamepadType;
```

## Remarks

This type does not necessarily map to first-party controllers from
Microsoft/Sony/Nintendo; in many cases, third-party controllers can report
as these, either because they were designed for a specific console, or they
simply most closely match that console's controllers (does it have A/B/X/Y
buttons or X/O/Square/Triangle? Does it have a touchpad? etc).
