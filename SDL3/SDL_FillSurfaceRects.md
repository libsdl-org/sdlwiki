# SDL_FillSurfaceRects

Perform a fast fill of a set of rectangles with a specific color.

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_FillSurfaceRects
    (SDL_Surface *dst, const SDL_Rect *rects, int count, Uint32 color);

```

## Function Parameters

|               |                                                                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **dst**       | the [SDL_Surface](SDL_Surface) structure that is the drawing target     |
| **rects**     | an array of [SDL_Rects](SDL_Rects) representing the rectangles to fill. |
| **count**     | the number of rectangles in the array                                   |
| **color**     | the color to fill with                                                  |

## Return Value

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

`color` should be a pixel of the format used by the surface, and can be
generated by [SDL_MapRGB](SDL_MapRGB)() or [SDL_MapRGBA](SDL_MapRGBA)(). If
the color value contains an alpha component then the destination is simply
filled with that alpha information, no blending takes place.

If there is a clip rectangle set on the destination (set via
[SDL_SetSurfaceClipRect](SDL_SetSurfaceClipRect)()), then this function
will fill based on the intersection of the clip rectangle and `rect`.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
