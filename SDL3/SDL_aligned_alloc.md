# SDL_aligned_alloc

Allocate memory aligned to a specific value

## Syntax

```c
SDL_MALLOC void* SDL_aligned_alloc(size_t alignment, size_t size);

```

## Function Parameters

|                   |                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| **alignment**     | the alignment requested |
| **size**          | the size to allocate    |

## Return Value

Returns a pointer to the aligned memory

## Remarks

If `alignment` is less than the size of `void *`, then it will be increased
to match that.

The returned memory address will be a multiple of the alignment value, and
the amount of memory allocated will be a multiple of the alignment value.

The memory returned by this function must be freed with
[SDL_aligned_free](SDL_aligned_free.md)()

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
