SDL_bool SDL_PenConnected(SDL_PenID instance_id);

```

## Function Parameters

|                     |           |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| **instance_id**     | A pen ID. |

## Return Value

Returns [SDL_TRUE](SDL_TRUE.md) if "instance_id" is valid and the
corresponding pen is attached, or [SDL_FALSE](SDL_FALSE.md) otherwise.

but may return default values.
