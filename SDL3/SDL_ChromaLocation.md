###### (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/) is the current stable version!)
# SDL_ChromaLocation

The chroma sample location

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_pixels.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_pixels.h), but apps should use `#include <SDL3/SDL.h>`

## Syntax

```c
typedef enum SDL_ChromaLocation
{
    SDL_CHROMA_LOCATION_NONE = 0,   /**< RGB, no chroma sampling */
    SDL_CHROMA_LOCATION_LEFT = 1,   /**< In MPEG-2, MPEG-4, and AVC, Cb and Cr are taken on midpoint of the left-edge of the 2x2 square. In other words, they have the same horizontal location as the top-left pixel, but is shifted one-half pixel down vertically. */
    SDL_CHROMA_LOCATION_CENTER = 2, /**< In JPEG/JFIF, H.261, and MPEG-1, Cb and Cr are taken at the center of the 2x2 square. In other words, they are offset one-half pixel to the right and one-half pixel down compared to the top-left pixel. */
    SDL_CHROMA_LOCATION_TOPLEFT = 3 /**< In HEVC for BT.2020 and BT.2100 content (in particular on Blu-rays), Cb and Cr are sampled at the same location as the group's top-left Y pixel ("co-sited", "co-located"). */
} SDL_ChromaLocation;
```

## Version

This enum is available since SDL 3.0.0.
