# SDL_GetNumJoystickAxes

Get the number of general axis controls on a joystick.

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_GetNumJoystickAxes(SDL_Joystick *joystick);

```

## Function Parameters

|                  |                                                                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **joystick**     | an [SDL_Joystick](SDL_Joystick.md) structure containing joystick information |

## Return Value

Returns the number of axis controls/number of axes on success or a negative
error code on failure; call [SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError.md)() for more
information.

## Remarks

Often, the directional pad on a game controller will either look like 4
separate buttons or a POV hat, and not axes, but all of this is up to the
device and platform.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
