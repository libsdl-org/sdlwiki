# SDL_SetSurfaceBlendMode

Set the blend mode used for blit operations.

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_SetSurfaceBlendMode(SDL_Surface *surface,
                            SDL_BlendMode blendMode);

```

## Function Parameters

|                   |                                                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **surface**       | the [SDL_Surface](SDL_Surface.md) structure to update          |
| **blendMode**     | the [SDL_BlendMode](SDL_BlendMode.md) to use for blit blending |

## Return Value

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError.md)() for more information.

## Remarks

To copy a surface to another surface (or texture) without blending with the
existing data, the blendmode of the SOURCE surface should be set to
[`SDL_BLENDMODE_NONE`](SDL_BLENDMODE_NONE).

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
