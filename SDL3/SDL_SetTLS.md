# SDL_SetTLS

Set the current thread's value associated with a thread local storage ID.

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_SetTLS(SDL_TLSID id, const void *value, void (SDLCALL *destructor)(void*));

```

## Function Parameters

|                    |                                                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **id**             | the thread local storage ID                                |
| **value**          | the value to associate with the ID for the current thread  |
| **destructor**     | a function called when the thread exits, to free the value |

## Return Value

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

The function prototype for `destructor` is:

```c
void destructor(void *value)
```

where its parameter `value` is what was passed as `value` to
[SDL_SetTLS](SDL_SetTLS)().

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
