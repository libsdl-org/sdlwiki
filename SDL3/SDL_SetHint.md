###### (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/) is the current stable version!)
# SDL_SetHint

Set a hint with normal priority.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_hints.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_hints.h), but apps should use `#include <SDL3/SDL.h>`

## Syntax

```c
SDL_bool SDL_SetHint(const char *name,
                     const char *value);

```

## Function Parameters

|               |                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **name**      | the hint to set                |
| **value**     | the value of the hint variable |

## Return Value

Returns [SDL_TRUE](SDL_TRUE) if the hint was set, [SDL_FALSE](SDL_FALSE)
otherwise.

## Remarks

Hints will not be set if there is an existing override hint or environment
variable that takes precedence. You can use
[SDL_SetHintWithPriority](SDL_SetHintWithPriority)() to set the hint with
override priority instead.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.

## Code Examples

```c
/* Log most events (other than the really spammy ones) */
SDL_SetHint(SDL_HINT_LOGGING, "2");
```
