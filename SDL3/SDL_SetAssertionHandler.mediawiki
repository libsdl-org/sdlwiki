====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [https://wiki.libsdl.org/ SDL2] is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_SetAssertionHandler =

Set an application-defined assertion handler.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_SetAssertionHandler(
                    SDL_AssertionHandler handler,
                    void *userdata);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''handler'''
|the [[SDL_AssertionHandler]] function to call when an assertion fails or NULL for the default handler
|-
|'''userdata'''
|a pointer that is passed to <code>handler</code>
|}

== Remarks ==

This function allows an application to show its own assertion UI and/or
force the response to an assertion failure. If the application doesn't
provide this, SDL will try to do the right thing, popping up a
system-specific GUI dialog, and probably minimizing any fullscreen windows.

This callback may fire from any thread, but it runs wrapped in a mutex, so
it will only fire from one thread at a time.

This callback is NOT reset to SDL's internal handler upon [[SDL_Quit]]()!

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
