###### (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/) is the current stable version!)
# SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI_XBOX_360

A variable controlling whether the HIDAPI driver for XBox 360 controllers should be used.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_hints.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_hints.h), but apps should use `#include <SDL3/SDL.h>`

## Syntax

```c
#define SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI_XBOX_360   "SDL_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI_XBOX_360"
```

## Remarks

The variable can be set to the following values:

- "0": HIDAPI driver is not used.
- "1": HIDAPI driver is used.

The default is the value of
[SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI_XBOX](SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI_XBOX)

This hint should be set before enumerating controllers.

## Version

This hint is available since SDL 3.0.0.
