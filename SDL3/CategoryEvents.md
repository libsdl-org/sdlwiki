# CategoryEvents

Event queue management.

It's extremely common--often required--that an app deal with SDL's event
queue. Almost all useful information about interactions with the real world
flow through here: the user interacting with the computer and app, hardware
coming and going, the system changing in some way, etc.

An app generally takes a moment, perhaps at the start of a new frame, to
examine any events that have occurred since the last time and process or
ignore them. This is generally done by calling
[SDL_PollEvent](SDL_PollEvent)() in a loop until it returns false (or, if
using the main callbacks, events are provided one at a time in calls to
[SDL_AppEvent](SDL_AppEvent)() before the next call to
[SDL_AppIterate](SDL_AppIterate)(); in this scenario, the app does not call
[SDL_PollEvent](SDL_PollEvent)() at all).

There is other forms of control, too: [SDL_PeepEvents](SDL_PeepEvents)()
has more functionality at the cost of more complexity, and
[SDL_WaitEvent](SDL_WaitEvent)() can block the process until something
interesting happens, which might be beneficial for certain types of
programs on low-power hardware. One may also call
[SDL_AddEventWatch](SDL_AddEventWatch)() to set a callback when new events
arrive.

The app is free to generate their own events, too:
[SDL_PushEvent](SDL_PushEvent) allows the app to put events onto the queue
for later retrieval; [SDL_RegisterEvents](SDL_RegisterEvents) can guarantee
that these events have a type that isn't in use by other parts of the
system.
