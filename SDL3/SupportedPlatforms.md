Note that the SDL maintainers do not test on all these platforms; if a less-common system breaks, [please let us know](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/new) and send patches if you can.

If you'd like to port SDL to a new platform, feel free to get in touch! [A guide to porting SDL2](https://discourse.libsdl.org/t/port-sdl-2-0-to-bios/25453/2) was written a while ago, and most of it still applies to SDL3.

## Removed Platforms

The following platforms were supported in SDL2, but were removed for SDL3:

- OS/2
- Google Stadia
- Windows UWP
- Older macOS releases (everything before 10.14 Mojave)
