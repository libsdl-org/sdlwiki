# SDL_GetRectAndLineIntersectionFloat

Calculate the intersection of a rectangle and line segment with float precision.

## Syntax

```c
SDL_bool SDL_GetRectAndLineIntersectionFloat(const SDL_FRect *
                                   rect, float *X1,
                                   float *Y1, float *X2,
                                   float *Y2);

```

## Function Parameters

|              |                                                                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **rect**     | an [SDL_FRect](SDL_FRect.md) structure representing the rectangle to intersect |
| **X1**       | a pointer to the starting X-coordinate of the line                          |
| **Y1**       | a pointer to the starting Y-coordinate of the line                          |
| **X2**       | a pointer to the ending X-coordinate of the line                            |
| **Y2**       | a pointer to the ending Y-coordinate of the line                            |

## Return Value

Returns [SDL_TRUE](SDL_TRUE.md) if there is an intersection,
[SDL_FALSE](SDL_FALSE.md) otherwise.

## Remarks

This function is used to clip a line segment to a rectangle. A line segment
contained entirely within the rectangle or that does not intersect will
remain unchanged. A line segment that crosses the rectangle at either or
both ends will be clipped to the boundary of the rectangle and the new
coordinates saved in `X1`, `Y1`, `X2`, and/or `Y2` as necessary.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
