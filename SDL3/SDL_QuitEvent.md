###### (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/) is the current stable version!)
# SDL_QuitEvent

The "quit requested" event

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_events.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_events.h), but apps should _only_ `#include <SDL3/SDL.h>`!

## Syntax

```c
typedef struct SDL_QuitEvent
{
    SDL_EventType type; /**< ::SDL_EVENT_QUIT */
    Uint32 reserved;
    Uint64 timestamp;   /**< In nanoseconds, populated using SDL_GetTicksNS() */
} SDL_QuitEvent;
```

## Version

This struct is available since SDL 3.0.0.
