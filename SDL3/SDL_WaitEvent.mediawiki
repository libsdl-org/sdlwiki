= SDL_WaitEvent =

Wait indefinitely for the next available event.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_WaitEvent(SDL_Event *event);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''event'''
|the [[SDL_Event]] structure to be filled in with the next event from the queue, or NULL
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 1 on success or 0 if there was an error while waiting for events;
call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

If <code>event</code> is not NULL, the next event is removed from the queue
and stored in the [[SDL_Event]] structure pointed to by <code>event</code>.

As this function may implicitly call [[SDL_PumpEvents]](), you can only
call this function in the thread that initialized the video subsystem.
