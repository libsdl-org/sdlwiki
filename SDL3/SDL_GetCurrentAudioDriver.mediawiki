====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! SDL2 is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_GetCurrentAudioDriver =

Get the name of the current audio driver.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
const char* SDL_GetCurrentAudioDriver(void);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Return Value ==

Returns the name of the current audio driver or NULL if no driver has been
initialized.

== Remarks ==

The returned string points to internal static memory and thus never becomes
invalid, even if you quit the audio subsystem and initialize a new driver
(although such a case would return a different static string from another
call to this function, of course). As such, you should not modify or free
the returned string.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.

== Code Examples ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
const char* driver_name = SDL_GetCurrentAudioDriver();

if (driver_name) {
    printf("Audio subsystem initialized; driver = %s.\n", driver_name);
} else {
    printf("Audio subsystem not initialized.\n");
}
</syntaxhighlight>
