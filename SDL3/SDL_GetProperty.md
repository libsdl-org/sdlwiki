# SDL_GetProperty

Get a property on a set of properties

## Syntax

```c
void* SDL_GetProperty(SDL_PropertiesID props, const char *name, void *default_value);

```

## Function Parameters

|                       |                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **props**             | the properties to query           |
| **name**              | the name of the property to query |
| **default_value**     | the default value of the property |

## Return Value

Returns the value of the property, or `default_value` if it is not set or
not a pointer property.

## Remarks

By convention, the names of properties that SDL exposes on objects will
start with "SDL.", and properties that SDL uses internally will start with
"SDL.internal.". These should be considered read-only and should not be
modified by applications.

## Thread Safety

It is safe to call this function from any thread, although the data
returned is not protected and could potentially be freed if you call
[SDL_SetProperty](SDL_SetProperty.md)() or
[SDL_ClearProperty](SDL_ClearProperty.md)() on these properties from another
thread. If you need to avoid this, use
[SDL_LockProperties](SDL_LockProperties.md)() and
[SDL_UnlockProperties](SDL_UnlockProperties.md)().

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
