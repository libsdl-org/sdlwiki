###### (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/) is the current stable version!)
# SDL_CreateCondition

Create a condition variable.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_mutex.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_mutex.h), but apps should use `#include <SDL3/SDL.h>`

## Syntax

```c
SDL_Condition* SDL_CreateCondition(void);

```

## Return Value

Returns a new condition variable or NULL on failure; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.

## Code Examples

Typical use of condition variables:


```c
// BEWARE: This code example was migrated from the SDL2 Wiki, by only updating the names.

SDL_bool condition = SDL_FALSE;
SDL_Mutex *lock;
SDL_Condition *cond;
lock = SDL_CreateMutex();
cond = SDL_CreateCondition();


Thread_A:
    SDL_LockMutex(lock);
    while (!condition) {
        SDL_WaitCondition(cond, lock);
    }
    SDL_UnlockMutex(lock);
Thread_B:
    SDL_LockMutex(lock);
    /* ... */
    condition = SDL_TRUE;
    /* ... */
    SDL_SignalCondition(cond);
    SDL_UnlockMutex(lock);

SDL_DestroyCondition(cond);
SDL_DestroyMutex(lock);
```
