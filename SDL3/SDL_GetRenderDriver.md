# SDL_GetRenderDriver

Use this function to get the name of a built in 2D rendering driver.

## Syntax

```c
const char* SDL_GetRenderDriver(int index);

```

## Function Parameters

|               |                                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **index**     | the index of the rendering driver; the value ranges from 0 to [SDL_GetNumRenderDrivers](SDL_GetNumRenderDrivers.md)() - 1 |

## Return Value

Returns the name of the rendering driver at the requested index, or NULL if
an invalid index was specified.

## Remarks

The list of rendering drivers is given in the order that they are normally
initialized by default; the drivers that seem more reasonable to choose
first (as far as the SDL developers believe) are earlier in the list.

The names of drivers are all simple, low-ASCII identifiers, like "opengl",
"direct3d12" or "metal". These never have Unicode characters, and are not
meant to be proper names.

The returned value points to a static, read-only string; do not modify or
free it!

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
