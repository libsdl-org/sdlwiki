# SDL_PenTouchEvent

Pressure-sensitive pen touched event structure (event.ptouch.*)

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_events.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_events.h)

## Syntax

```c
typedef struct SDL_PenTouchEvent
{
    SDL_EventType type;     /**< SDL_EVENT_PEN_DOWN or SDL_EVENT_PEN_UP */
    Uint32 reserved;
    Uint64 timestamp;       /**< In nanoseconds, populated using SDL_GetTicksNS() */
    SDL_WindowID windowID;  /**< The window with pen focus, if any */
    SDL_PenID which;        /**< The pen instance id */
    SDL_PenInputFlags pen_state;   /**< Complete pen input state at time of event */
    float x;                /**< X position of pen on tablet */
    float y;                /**< Y position of pen on tablet */
    bool eraser;        /**< true if eraser end is used (not all pens support this). */
    bool down;          /**< true if the pen is touching or false if the pen is lifted off */
} SDL_PenTouchEvent;
```

## Remarks

These events come when a pen touches a surface (a tablet, etc), or lifts
off from one.

## Version

This struct is available since SDL 3.0.0.
