## Remarks

These cover a lot of true/false, or on/off, window state. Some of it is
immutable after being set through [SDL_CreateWindow](SDL_CreateWindow)(),
some of it can be changed on existing windows by the app, and some of it
might be altered by the user or system outside of the app's control.

When creating windows with [`SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE`](SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE),
SDL will constrain resizable windows to the dimensions recommended by the
compositor to fit it within the usable desktop space, although some
compositors will do this automatically without intervention as well. Use
[`SDL_SetWindowResizable`](SDL_SetWindowResizable) after creation instead
if you wish to create a window with a specific size.

## Version

This datatype is available since SDL 3.2.0.
