# SDL_ThreadID

Get the thread identifier for the current thread.

## Syntax

```c
SDL_threadID SDL_ThreadID(void);

```

## Return Value

## Remarks

This thread identifier is as reported by the underlying operating system.
If SDL is running on a platform that does not support threads the return
value will always be zero.

This function also returns a valid thread ID when called from the main
thread.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.

## Code Examples

```c

SDL_ThreadID threadID;

/* Retrieve our current thread identifier */
threadID = SDL_GetCurrentThreadID();
```
