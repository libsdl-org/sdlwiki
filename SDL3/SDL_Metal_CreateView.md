# SDL_Metal_CreateView

Create a CAMetalLayer-backed NSView/UIView and attach it to the specified window.

## Syntax

```c
SDL_MetalView SDL_Metal_CreateView(SDL_Window * window);

```

## Function Parameters

|                |            |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| **window**     | the window |

## Return Value

Returns handle NSView or UIView

## Remarks

On macOS, this does *not* associate a MTLDevice with the CAMetalLayer on
its own. It is up to user code to do that.

The returned handle can be casted directly to a NSView or UIView. To access
the backing CAMetalLayer, call [SDL_Metal_GetLayer](SDL_Metal_GetLayer.md)().

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
