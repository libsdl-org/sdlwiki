# SDL_RenderDebugText

Draw debug text to an [SDL_Renderer](SDL_Renderer).

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_render.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_render.h)

## Syntax

```c
bool SDL_RenderDebugText(SDL_Renderer *renderer, float x, float y, const char *str);
```

## Function Parameters

|                                |              |                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [SDL_Renderer](SDL_Renderer) * | **renderer** | the renderer which should draw a line of text.                    |
| float                          | **x**        | the x coordinate where the top-left corner of the text will draw. |
| float                          | **y**        | the y coordinate where the top-left corner of the text will draw. |
| const char *                   | **str**      | the string to render.                                             |

## Return Value

(bool) Returns true on success or false on failure; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

This function will render a string of text to an
[SDL_Renderer](SDL_Renderer). Note that this is a convenience function for
debugging, with severe limitations, and not intended to be used for
production apps and games.

Among these limitations:

- It accepts UTF-8 strings, but will only renders ASCII characters.
- It has a single, tiny size (8x8 pixels). One can use logical presentation
  or scaling to adjust it, but it will be blurry.
- It uses a simple, hardcoded bitmap font. It does not allow different font
  selections and it does not support truetype, for proper scaling.
- It does no word-wrapping and does not treat newline characters as a line
  break. If the text goes out of the window, it's gone.

For serious text rendering, there are several good options, such as
[SDL_ttf](SDL_ttf), stb_truetype, or other external libraries.

On first use, this will create an internal texture for rendering glyphs.
This texture will live until the renderer is destroyed.

The text is drawn in the color specified by
[SDL_SetRenderDrawColor](SDL_SetRenderDrawColor)().

## Thread Safety

You may only call this function from the main thread.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.1.6.
