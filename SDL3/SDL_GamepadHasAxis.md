# SDL_GamepadHasAxis

Query whether a gamepad has a given axis.

## Syntax

```c
SDL_bool SDL_GamepadHasAxis(SDL_Gamepad *gamepad, SDL_GamepadAxis axis);

```

## Function Parameters

|                 |                                                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **gamepad**     | a gamepad                                                        |
| **axis**        | an axis enum value (an [SDL_GamepadAxis](SDL_GamepadAxis.md) value) |

## Return Value

Returns [SDL_TRUE](SDL_TRUE.md) if the gamepad has this axis,
[SDL_FALSE](SDL_FALSE.md) otherwise.

## Remarks

This merely reports whether the gamepad's mapping defined this axis, as
that is all the information SDL has about the physical device.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
