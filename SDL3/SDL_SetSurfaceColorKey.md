# SDL_SetSurfaceColorKey

Set the color key (transparent pixel) in a surface.

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_SetSurfaceColorKey(SDL_Surface *surface,
                    int flag, Uint32 key);

```

## Function Parameters

|                 |                                                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **surface**     | the [SDL_Surface](SDL_Surface.md) structure to update                                    |
| **flag**        | [SDL_TRUE](SDL_TRUE.md) to enable color key, [SDL_FALSE](SDL_FALSE.md) to disable color key |
| **key**         | the transparent pixel                                                                 |

## Return Value

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError.md)() for more information.

## Remarks

The color key defines a pixel value that will be treated as transparent in
a blit. For example, one can use this to specify that cyan pixels should be
considered transparent, and therefore not rendered.

It is a pixel of the format used by the surface, as generated by
[SDL_MapRGB](SDL_MapRGB.md)().

RLE acceleration can substantially speed up blitting of images with large
horizontal runs of transparent pixels. See
[SDL_SetSurfaceRLE](SDL_SetSurfaceRLE.md)() for details.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
