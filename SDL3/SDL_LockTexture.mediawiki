====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! SDL2 is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_LockTexture =

Lock a portion of the texture for '''write-only''' pixel access.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_LockTexture(SDL_Texture * texture,
                    const SDL_Rect * rect,
                    void **pixels, int *pitch);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''texture'''
|the texture to lock for access, which was created with <code>[[SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING]]</code>
|-
|'''rect'''
|an [[SDL_Rect]] structure representing the area to lock for access; NULL to lock the entire texture
|-
|'''pixels'''
|this is filled in with a pointer to the locked pixels, appropriately offset by the locked area
|-
|'''pitch'''
|this is filled in with the pitch of the locked pixels; the pitch is the length of one row in bytes
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code if the texture is not valid
or was not created with <code>[[SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING]]</code>; call
[[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

As an optimization, the pixels made available for editing don't necessarily
contain the old texture data. This is a write-only operation, and if you
need to keep a copy of the texture data you should do that at the
application level.

You must use [[SDL_UnlockTexture]]() to unlock the pixels and apply any
changes.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
