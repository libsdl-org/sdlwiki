## Function Parameters

|                  |                                                             |

| **appinit**      | The application's [SDL_AppInit](SDL_AppInit.md) function       |
| **appiter**      | The application's [SDL_AppIterate](SDL_AppIterate.md) function |
| **appevent**     | The application's [SDL_AppEvent](SDL_AppEvent.md) function     |

## Remarks

Generally, you should not call this function directly. This only exists to
hand off work into SDL as soon as possible, where it has a lot more control
and functionality available, and make the inline code in
[SDL_main](SDL_main.md).h as small as possible.

Not all platforms use this, it's actual use is hidden in a magic
header-only library, and you should not call this directly unless you
_really_ know what you're doing.

## Thread Safety

It is not safe to call this anywhere except as the only function call in
[SDL_main](SDL_main.md).

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
