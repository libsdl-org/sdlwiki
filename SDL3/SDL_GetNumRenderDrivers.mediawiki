====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! SDL2 is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_GetNumRenderDrivers =

Get the number of 2D rendering drivers available for the current display.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_GetNumRenderDrivers(void);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Return Value ==

Returns a number >= 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

A render driver is a set of code that handles rendering and texture
management on a particular display. Normally there is only one, but some
drivers may have several available with different capabilities.

There may be none if SDL was compiled without render support.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
