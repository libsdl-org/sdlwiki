== Code Examples ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
Uint32 flags = SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL | SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN;
SDL_Window * window = SDL_CreateWindow(
    /* ... */
    flags
);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==
The SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL flag prepares your window for use with OpenGL, but you will still need to create an OpenGL context using [[SDL_GL_CreateContext]]() after window creation, before calling any OpenGL functions.

On Apple's OS X you '''must''' set the NSHighResolutionCapable Info.plist property to YES, otherwise you will not receive a High DPI OpenGL canvas.

== Version ==
This enumeration is available since SDL 2.0.0.
