# SDL_CreateSurfaceFrom

Allocate a new RGB surface with a specific pixel format and existing pixel data.

## Syntax

```c
SDL_Surface* SDL_CreateSurfaceFrom
    (void *pixels, int width, int height, int pitch, Uint32 format);

```

## Function Parameters

|                |                                                                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **pixels**     | a pointer to existing pixel data                                                   |
| **width**      | the width of the surface                                                           |
| **height**     | the height of the surface                                                          |
| **pitch**      | the pitch of the surface in bytes                                                  |
| **format**     | the [SDL_PixelFormatEnum](SDL_PixelFormatEnum) for the new surface's pixel format. |

## Return Value

Returns the new [SDL_Surface](SDL_Surface) structure that is created or
NULL if it fails; call [SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

No copy is made of the pixel data. Pixel data is not managed automatically;
you must free the surface before you free the pixel data.

You may pass NULL for pixels and 0 for pitch to create a surface that you
will fill in with valid values later.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
