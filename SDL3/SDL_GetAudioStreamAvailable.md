# SDL_GetAudioStreamAvailable

Get the number of converted/resampled bytes available.

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_GetAudioStreamAvailable(SDL_AudioStream *stream);

```

## Function Parameters

|                |                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| **stream**     | The audio stream to query |

## Return Value

Returns the number of converted/resampled bytes available.

## Remarks

The stream may be buffering data behind the scenes until it has enough to
resample correctly, so this number might be lower than what you expect, or
even be zero. Add more data or flush the stream if you need the data now.

If the stream has so much data that it would overflow an int, the return
value is clamped to a maximum value, but no queued data is lost; if there
are gigabytes of data queued, the app might need to read some of it with
[SDL_GetAudioStreamData](SDL_GetAudioStreamData.md) before this function's
return value is no longer clamped.

## Thread Safety

It is safe to call this function from any thread.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
