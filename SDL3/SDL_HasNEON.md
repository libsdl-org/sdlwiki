# SDL_HasNEON

Determine whether the CPU has NEON (ARM SIMD) features.

## Syntax

```c
SDL_bool SDL_HasNEON(void);

```

## Return Value

Returns [SDL_TRUE](SDL_TRUE.md) if the CPU has ARM NEON features or
[SDL_FALSE](SDL_FALSE.md) if not.

## Remarks

This always returns false on CPUs that aren't using ARM instruction sets.

## Version
