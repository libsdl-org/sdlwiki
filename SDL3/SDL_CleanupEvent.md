# SDL_CleanupEvent

Clean up dynamically allocated memory for an event.

## Syntax

```c
void SDL_CleanupEvent(SDL_Event *event);

```

## Function Parameters

|               |                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **event**     | a pointer to the event that should be cleaned up |

## Remarks

Some events have dynamically allocated data that must be cleaned up when
the event is processed. If you handle any of these events, you should call
[SDL_CleanupEvent](SDL_CleanupEvent.md)() after processing them:
[SDL_EVENT_DROP_FILE](SDL_EVENT_DROP_FILE.md)
[SDL_EVENT_DROP_TEXT](SDL_EVENT_DROP_TEXT.md)
[SDL_EVENT_SYSWM](SDL_EVENT_SYSWM.md)
[SDL_EVENT_TEXT_EDITING](SDL_EVENT_TEXT_EDITING.md)

It is safe, but not necessary, to call this function for other event types.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
