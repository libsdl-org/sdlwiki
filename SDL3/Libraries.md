# Libraries

These libraries can extend the core SDL functionality.

Please note that several of these have names that start with "SDL_", but none of them are part of the core SDL library. They are _separate_ and _optional_ extras!

## SDL_image

Loads images as SDL surfaces and textures, and supports the following formats:
BMP, GIF, JPEG, LBM, PCX, PNG, PNM, SVG, TGA, TIFF, WEBP, XCF, XPM, XV (and more!)

## SDL_mixer

SDL_mixer is a sample multi-channel audio mixer library. It supports any number
of simultaneously playing channels of 16 bit stereo audio, plus a single
channel of music, mixed by the popular FLAC, MikMod MOD, Timidity MIDI, Ogg
Vorbis, and SMPEG MP3 libraries.

## SDL_ttf

A library which allows you to use TrueType fonts in your SDL applications. It
comes with an example program "showfont" which displays an example string for a
given TrueType font file.
