# SDL_AcquireGPUSwapchainTexture

Acquire a texture to use in presentation.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_gpu.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_gpu.h)

## Syntax

```c
bool SDL_AcquireGPUSwapchainTexture(
    SDL_GPUCommandBuffer *command_buffer,
    SDL_Window *window,
    SDL_GPUTexture **swapchain_texture,
    Uint32 *swapchain_texture_width,
    Uint32 *swapchain_texture_height);
```

## Function Parameters

|                                                |                              |                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [SDL_GPUCommandBuffer](SDL_GPUCommandBuffer) * | **command_buffer**           | a command buffer.                                                   |
| [SDL_Window](SDL_Window) *                     | **window**                   | a window that has been claimed.                                     |
| [SDL_GPUTexture](SDL_GPUTexture) **            | **swapchain_texture**        | a pointer filled in with a swapchain texture handle.                |
| Uint32 *                                       | **swapchain_texture_width**  | a pointer filled in with the swapchain texture width, may be NULL.  |
| Uint32 *                                       | **swapchain_texture_height** | a pointer filled in with the swapchain texture height, may be NULL. |

## Return Value

(bool) Returns true on success, false on error; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

When a swapchain texture is acquired on a command buffer, it will
automatically be submitted for presentation when the command buffer is
submitted. The swapchain texture should only be referenced by the command
buffer used to acquire it. The swapchain texture handle can be filled in
with NULL under certain conditions. This is not necessarily an error. If
this function returns false then there is an error. However, the texture
handle being NULL does mean that the swapchain is not available currently.
Thus, this NULL pointer should not be passed back into SDL. Instead, it
should be considered as an indication to wait until the swapchain is 
available.

The swapchain texture is managed by the implementation and must not be
freed by the user. You MUST NOT call this function from any thread other
than the one that created the window.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.1.3.
