# SDL_RenderViewportSet

Return whether an explicit rectangle was set as the viewport.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_render.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_render.h)

## Syntax

```c
bool SDL_RenderViewportSet(SDL_Renderer *renderer);
```

## Function Parameters

|                                |              |                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| [SDL_Renderer](SDL_Renderer) * | **renderer** | the rendering context. |

## Return Value

(bool) Returns true if the viewport was set to a specific rectangle, or
false if it was set to NULL (the entire target).

## Remarks

This is useful if you're saving and restoring the viewport and want to know
whether you should restore a specific rectangle or NULL.

Each render target has its own viewport. This function checks the viewport
for the current render target.

## Thread Safety

This function should only be called on the main thread.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.
