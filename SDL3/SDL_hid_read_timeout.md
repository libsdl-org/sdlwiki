# SDL_hid_read_timeout

Read an Input report from a HID device with timeout.

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_hid_read_timeout(SDL_hid_device *dev, unsigned char *data, size_t length, int milliseconds);

```

## Function Parameters

|                      |                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **dev**              | A device handle returned from [SDL_hid_open](SDL_hid_open.md)().                                                          |
| **data**             | A buffer to put the read data into.                                                                                    |
| **length**           | The number of bytes to read. For devices with multiple reports, make sure to read an extra byte for the report number. |
| **milliseconds**     | timeout in milliseconds or -1 for blocking wait.                                                                       |

## Return Value

Returns the actual number of bytes read and -1 on error. If no packet was
available to be read within the timeout period, this function returns 0.

## Remarks

Input reports are returned to the host through the INTERRUPT IN endpoint.
The first byte will contain the Report number if the device uses numbered
reports.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
