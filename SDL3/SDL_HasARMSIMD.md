# SDL_HasARMSIMD

Determine whether the CPU has ARM SIMD (ARMv6) features.

## Syntax

```c
SDL_bool SDL_HasARMSIMD(void);

```

## Return Value

Returns [SDL_TRUE](SDL_TRUE.md) if the CPU has ARM SIMD features or
[SDL_FALSE](SDL_FALSE.md) if not.

## Remarks

This is different from ARM NEON, which is a different instruction set.

This always returns false on CPUs that aren't using ARM instruction sets.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
