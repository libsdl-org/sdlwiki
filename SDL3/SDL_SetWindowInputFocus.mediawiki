= SDL_SetWindowInputFocus =

Explicitly set input focus to the window.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_SetWindowInputFocus(SDL_Window * window);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''window'''
|the window that should get the input focus
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

You almost certainly want [[SDL_RaiseWindow]]() instead of this function.
Use this with caution, as you might give focus to a window that is
completely obscured by other windows.
