# SDL_GetMouseState

Query SDL's cache for the synchronous mouse button state and the window-relative SDL-cursor position.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_mouse.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_mouse.h)

## Syntax

```c
SDL_MouseButtonFlags SDL_GetMouseState(float *x, float *y);
```

## Function Parameters

|         |       |                                                                                                                |
| ------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| float * | **x** | a pointer to receive the SDL-cursor's x-position from the focused window's top left corner, can be NULL if unused. |
| float * | **y** | a pointer to receive the SDL-cursor's y-position from the focused window's top left corner, can be NULL if unused. |

## Return Value

([SDL_MouseButtonFlags](SDL_MouseButtonFlags)) a 32-bit bitmask of the button state that can be bitwise-compared against the [SDL_BUTTON_MASK](SDL_BUTTON_MASK)(X) macro.

## Remarks

This function returns the cached synchronous state as SDL understands it from the last pump of the event queue. 

To query the platform for immediate asynchronous state, use [SDL_GetGlobalMouseState](SDL_GetGlobalMouseState).

Passing non-NULL pointers to `x` or `y` will write the destination with respective x or y coordinates relative to the focused window.

In Relative Mode, the SDL-cursor's position usually contradicts the platform-cursor's position as manually calculated from [SDL_GetGlobalMouseState](SDL_GetGlobalMouseState)() and [SDL_GetWindowPosition](SDL_GetWindowPosition).

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.1.3.
