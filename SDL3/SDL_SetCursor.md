# SDL_SetCursor

Set the active cursor.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_mouse.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_mouse.h), but apps should use `#include <SDL3/SDL.h>`

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_SetCursor(SDL_Cursor * cursor);

```

## Function Parameters

|                |                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| **cursor**     | a cursor to make active |

## Return Value

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

This function sets the currently active cursor to the specified one. If the
cursor is currently visible, the change will be immediately represented on
the display. [SDL_SetCursor](SDL_SetCursor)(NULL) can be used to force
cursor redraw, if this is desired for any reason.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
