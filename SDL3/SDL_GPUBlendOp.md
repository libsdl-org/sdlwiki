###### (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/) is the current stable version!)
# SDL_GPUBlendOp

Specifies the operator to be used when pixels in a render pass texture attachment are blended with existing pixels in the texture.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_gpu.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_gpu.h)

## Syntax

```c
typedef enum SDL_GPUBlendOp
{
    SDL_GPU_BLENDOP_ADD,               /**< (source * source_factor) + (destination * destination_factor) */
    SDL_GPU_BLENDOP_SUBTRACT,          /**< (source * source_factor) - (destination * destination_factor) */
    SDL_GPU_BLENDOP_REVERSE_SUBTRACT,  /**< (destination * destination_factor) - (source * source_factor) */
    SDL_GPU_BLENDOP_MIN,               /**< min(source, destination) */
    SDL_GPU_BLENDOP_MAX                /**< max(source, destination) */
} SDL_GPUBlendOp;
```

## Remarks

The source color is the value written by the fragment shader. The
destination color is the value currently existing in the texture.

## Version

This enum is available since SDL 3.0.0
