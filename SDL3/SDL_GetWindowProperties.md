# SDL_GetWindowProperties

Get the properties associated with a window.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_video.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_video.h), but apps should _only_ `#include <SDL3/SDL.h>`!

## Syntax

```c
SDL_PropertiesID SDL_GetWindowProperties(SDL_Window *window);

```

## Function Parameters

|                |                     |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| **window**     | the window to query |

## Return Value

Returns a valid property ID on success or 0 on failure; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

  the EGLSurface associated with the window

On UWP:

- [`SDL_PROP_WINDOW_WINRT_WINDOW_POINTER`](SDL_PROP_WINDOW_WINRT_WINDOW_POINTER):
  the IInspectable CoreWindow associated with the window

On Windows:

- [`SDL_PROP_WINDOW_WIN32_HWND_POINTER`](SDL_PROP_WINDOW_WIN32_HWND_POINTER):
  the HWND associated with the window

- [`SDL_PROP_WINDOW_WIN32_INSTANCE_POINTER`](SDL_PROP_WINDOW_WIN32_INSTANCE_POINTER):
  the HINSTANCE associated with the window

On Wayland:

Note: The `xdg_*` window objects do not internally persist across window
show/hide calls. They will be null if the window is hidden and must be
queried each time it is shown.

- [`SDL_PROP_WINDOW_WAYLAND_DISPLAY_POINTER`](SDL_PROP_WINDOW_WAYLAND_DISPLAY_POINTER):
  the wl_display associated with the window
