###### (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/) is the current stable version!)
# SDL_GetClipboardData

Get the data from clipboard for a given mime type.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_clipboard.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_clipboard.h), but apps should _only_ `#include <SDL3/SDL.h>`!

## Syntax

```c
void* SDL_GetClipboardData(const char *mime_type, size_t *size);

```

## Function Parameters

|                   |                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **mime_type**     | The mime type to read from the clipboard                 |
| **size**          | A pointer filled in with the length of the returned data |

## Return Value

Returns the retrieved data buffer or NULL on failure; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information. Caller must call
[SDL_free](SDL_free)() on the returned pointer when done with it.

## Remarks

The size of text data does not include the terminator, but the text is
guaranteed to be null terminated.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
