# SDL_AddGamepadMappingsFromRW

Load a set of gamepad mappings from a seekable SDL data stream.

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_AddGamepadMappingsFromRW(SDL_RWops *src, SDL_bool freesrc);

```

## Function Parameters

|                 |                                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **src**         | the data stream for the mappings to be added                                                                        |
| **freesrc**     | if [SDL_TRUE](SDL_TRUE.md), calls [SDL_RWclose](SDL_RWclose.md)() on `src` before returning, even in the case of an error |

## Return Value

Returns the number of mappings added or -1 on error; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError.md)() for more information.

## Remarks

You can call this function several times, if needed, to load different
database files.

If a new mapping is loaded for an already known gamepad GUID, the later
version will overwrite the one currently loaded.

Mappings not belonging to the current platform or with no platform field
specified will be ignored (i.e. mappings for Linux will be ignored in
Windows, etc).

This function will load the text database entirely in memory before
processing it, so take this into consideration if you are in a memory
constrained environment.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
