# Simple DirectMedia Layer 3.0

This is the SDL3 wiki. SDL2 is [over here](/SDL2)!

## What is it?

Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed to
provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics
hardware via OpenGL/Direct3D/Metal/Vulkan. It is used by video playback
software, emulators, and popular games including
[Valve](https://valvesoftware.com)'s award winning catalog and many
[Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com) games.

SDL officially supports Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android, and several
other platforms.

SDL is written in C, works natively with C++, and has bindings available for
several other languages, including C# and Python.

SDL 3.0 (often shortened to "SDL3") is distributed under the
[zlib license](https://www.libsdl.org/license.php). This license allows you
to use SDL freely in any software.

This is the SDL wiki; SDL's main website is [libsdl.org](https://libsdl.org/).

This wiki is your portal to documentation and other resources for SDL 3.0.
