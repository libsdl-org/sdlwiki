= SDLNet_AddSocket =

Add a socket to a socket set, to be checked for available data.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDLNet_AddSocket(SDLNet_SocketSet set, SDLNet_GenericSocket sock);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''set'''
|the socket set to add a new socket to.
|-
|'''sock'''
|the socket to add to the set.
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns the total number of sockets contained in the set (including this
new one), or -1 if the set is already full.

== Remarks ==

Generally you don't want to call this generic function, but rather the
specific, inline function that wraps it: [[SDLNet_TCP_AddSocket]]() or
[[SDLNet_UDP_AddSocket]]().

This function will fail if you add a socket to the set when the set already
has its maximum number of sockets added, but otherwise it will always
succeed.

If <code>sock</code> is NULL, nothing is added to the set; this lets you
query the number of sockets currently contained in the set.
