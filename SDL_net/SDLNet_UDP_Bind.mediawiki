====== (This function is part of SDL_net, a separate library from SDL.) ======
= SDLNet_UDP_Bind =

Bind an address to the requested channel on the UDP socket.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDLNet_UDP_Bind(UDPsocket sock, int channel, const IPaddress *address);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''sock'''
|the UDP socket to bind an address to a channel on.
|-
|'''channel'''
|the channel of the socket to bind to, or -1 to use the first available channel.
|-
|'''address'''
|the address to bind to the socket's channel.
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns the channel which was bound, or -1 on error.

== Remarks ==

Note that UDP sockets at the platform layer "bind" to a nework port number,
but SDL_net's UDP sockets also "bind" to a "channel" on top of that, with
[[SDLNet_UDP_Bind]](). But the term is used for both.

If <code>channel</code> is -1, then the first unbound channel that has not
yet been bound to the maximum number of addresses will be bound with the
given address as it's primary address.

If the channel is already bound, this new address will be added to the list
of valid source addresses for packets arriving on the channel. If the
channel is not already bound, then the address becomes the primary address,
to which all outbound packets on the channel are sent.
