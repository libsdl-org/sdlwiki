# SDLNet_TCP_Close

Close a TCP network socket.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL_net.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_net/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_net.h)

## Syntax

```c
void SDLNet_TCP_Close(TCPsocket sock);
```

## Function Parameters

|           |          |                  |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| TCPsocket | **sock** | socket to close. |

## Remarks

All TCP sockets (server and non-server) are deinitialized through this
function. Call this once you are done with a socket, and assume the handle
is invalid once you have.

Closing a socket will disconnect any communication and free its resources.
