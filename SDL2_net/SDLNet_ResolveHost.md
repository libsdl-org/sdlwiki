## Syntax

int SDLNet_ResolveHost(IPaddress *address, const char *host, Uint16 port);

```

|                 |                                                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **address**     | to be filled in with the resolved address and port.         |
| **host**        | the hostname to lookup (like "libsdl.org")                  |
| **port**        | the port intended to be connected to, to fill into address. |

## Return Value
