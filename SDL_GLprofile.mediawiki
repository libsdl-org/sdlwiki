= SDL_GLprofile =
An enumeration of OpenGL profiles.



== Values ==
{|
|SDL_GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_CORE
|OpenGL core profile - deprecated functions are disabled
|-
|SDL_GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_COMPATIBILITY
|OpenGL compatibility profile - deprecated functions are allowed
|-
|SDL_GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_ES
|OpenGL ES profile - only a subset of the base OpenGL functionality is available
|}

== Code Examples ==
```c++
SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK, SDL_GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_ES);
```


== Remarks ==
This enumeration is used in conjunction with [[SDL_GL_SetAttribute]]() and [[SDL_GLattr|SDL_GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK]].  Although the name [[SDL_GLattr|SDL_GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK]] implies that multiple flags can be OR'd together, the profiles are mutually exclusive, and [[SDL_GL_SetAttribute]]() accepts at most one of them.  Setting the [[SDL_GLattr|SDL_GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK]] attribute to 0 leaves the choice of profile up to SDL.  Should be used in conjunction with the [[SDL_GLattr|SDL_GL_CONTEXT_MAJOR_VERSION]] and [[SDL_GLattr|SDL_GL_CONTEXT_MINOR_VERSION]] attributes, since OpenGL profiles are defined relative to a particular version of OpenGL.  There is no way to distinguish between the common and common lite profiles of OpenGL ES versions 1.0 and 1.1.
