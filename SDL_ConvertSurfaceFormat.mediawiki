= SDL_ConvertSurfaceFormat =

Copy an existing surface to a new surface of the specified format enum.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
SDL_Surface* SDL_ConvertSurfaceFormat
    (SDL_Surface * src, Uint32 pixel_format, Uint32 flags);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''src'''
|the existing [[SDL_Surface]] structure to convert
|-
|'''pixel_format'''
|the [[SDL_PixelFormatEnum]] that the new surface is optimized for
|-
|'''flags'''
|the flags are unused and should be set to 0; this is a leftover from SDL 1.2's API
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns the new SDL_Surface structure that is created or NULL if it fails;
call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.



== Remarks ==

This function operates just like [[SDL_ConvertSurface]](), but accepts an
[[SDL_PixelFormatEnum]] value instead of an [[SDL_PixelFormat]] structure.
As such, it might be easier to call but it doesn't have access to palette
information for the destination surface, in case that would be important.
