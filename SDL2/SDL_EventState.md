# SDL_EventState

Set the state of processing events by type.

## Syntax

```c
Uint8 SDL_EventState(Uint32 type, int state);

```

## Function Parameters

|               |                                                                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **type**      | the type of event; see [SDL_EventType](SDL_EventType.md) for details |
| **state**     | how to process the event                                          |

## Return Value

Returns [`SDL_DISABLE`](SDL_DISABLE) or [`SDL_ENABLE`](SDL_ENABLE),
representing the processing state of the event before this function makes
any changes to it.

## Remarks

`state` may be any of the following:

- [`SDL_QUERY`](SDL_QUERY): returns the current processing state of the
  specified event
- [`SDL_IGNORE`](SDL_IGNORE) (aka [`SDL_DISABLE`](SDL_DISABLE)): the event
  will automatically be dropped from the event queue and will not be
  filtered
- [`SDL_ENABLE`](SDL_ENABLE): the event will be processed normally
