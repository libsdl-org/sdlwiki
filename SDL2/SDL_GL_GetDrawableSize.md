# SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize

Get the size of a window's underlying drawable in pixels.

## Syntax

```c
void SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize(SDL_Window * window, int *w,
                            int *h);

```

## Function Parameters

|                |                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **window**     | the window from which the drawable size should be queried           |
| **w**          | a pointer to variable for storing the width in pixels, may be NULL  |
| **h**          | a pointer to variable for storing the height in pixels, may be NULL |

## Remarks

This returns info useful for calling glViewport().

This may differ from [SDL_GetWindowSize](SDL_GetWindowSize.md)() if we're
rendering to a high-DPI drawable, i.e. the window was created with
[`SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI`](SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI) on a platform with
high-DPI support (Apple calls this "Retina"), and not disabled by the
[`SDL_HINT_VIDEO_HIGHDPI_DISABLED`](SDL_HINT_VIDEO_HIGHDPI_DISABLED) hint.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.1.
