'''Include File(s):'''  [https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_syswm.h SDL_syswm.h]


== Introduction ==
This category contains functions for handling advanced, platform-specific window management tasks.

Your application has access to a special type of event, [[SDL_SysWMEvent|SDL_SYSWMEVENT]], which uses the [[SDL_SysWMmsg]] structure and contains window-manager specific information.  This arrives whenever an unhandled window event occurs.  This event is ignored by default, but you can enable it with [[SDL_EventState]]().
