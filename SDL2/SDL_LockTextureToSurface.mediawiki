= SDL_LockTextureToSurface =

Lock a portion of the texture for '''write-only''' pixel access, and expose it as a SDL surface.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_LockTextureToSurface(SDL_Texture *texture,
                    const SDL_Rect *rect,
                    SDL_Surface **surface);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''texture'''
|the texture to lock for access, which was created with <code>[[SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING]]</code>
|-
|'''rect'''
|a pointer to the rectangle to lock for access. If the rect is NULL, the entire texture will be locked
|-
|'''surface'''
|this is filled in with an SDL surface representing the locked area
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success, or -1 if the texture is not valid or was not created
with <code>[[SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING]]</code>

== Remarks ==

Besides providing an [[SDL_Surface]] instead of raw pixel data, this
function operates like [[SDL_LockTexture]].

As an optimization, the pixels made available for editing don't necessarily
contain the old texture data. This is a write-only operation, and if you
need to keep a copy of the texture data you should do that at the
application level.

You must use [[SDL_UnlockTexture]]() to unlock the pixels and apply any
changes.

The returned surface is freed internally after calling
[[SDL_UnlockTexture]]() or [[SDL_DestroyTexture]](). The caller should not
free it.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.12.
