# SDL_UnlockMutex

Unlock the mutex.

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_UnlockMutex(SDL_mutex * mutex) SDL_RELEASE(mutex);

```

## Function Parameters

|               |                      |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| **mutex**     | the mutex to unlock. |

## Return Value

Returns 0, or -1 on error.

## Remarks

It is legal for the owning thread to lock an already-locked mutex. It must
unlock it the same number of times before it is actually made available for
other threads in the system (this is known as a "recursive mutex").

It is an error to unlock a mutex that has not been locked by the current
thread, and doing so results in undefined behavior.

It is also an error to unlock a mutex that isn't locked at all.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
