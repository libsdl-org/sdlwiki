====== (This is the legacy documentation for stable SDL2, the current stable version; SDL3 is the current development version.) ======
= SDL_GetTicks =

Get the number of milliseconds since SDL library initialization.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
Uint32 SDL_GetTicks(void);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Return Value ==

Returns an unsigned 32-bit value representing the number of milliseconds
since the SDL library initialized.

== Remarks ==

This value wraps if the program runs for more than ~49 days.

This function is not recommended as of SDL 2.0.18; use [[SDL_GetTicks64]]()
instead, where the value doesn't wrap every ~49 days. There are places in
SDL where we provide a 32-bit timestamp that can not change without
breaking binary compatibility, though, so this function isn't officially
deprecated.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
