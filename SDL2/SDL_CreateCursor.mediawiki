= SDL_CreateCursor =

Create a cursor using the specified bitmap data and mask (in MSB format).

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
SDL_Cursor* SDL_CreateCursor(const Uint8 * data,
                             const Uint8 * mask,
                             int w, int h, int hot_x,
                             int hot_y);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''data'''
|the color value for each pixel of the cursor
|-
|'''mask'''
|the mask value for each pixel of the cursor
|-
|'''w'''
|the width of the cursor
|-
|'''h'''
|the height of the cursor
|-
|'''hot_x'''
|the X-axis location of the upper left corner of the cursor relative to the actual mouse position
|-
|'''hot_y'''
|the Y-axis location of the upper left corner of the cursor relative to the actual mouse position
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns a new cursor with the specified parameters on success or NULL on
failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

<code>mask</code> has to be in MSB (Most Significant Bit) format.

The cursor width (<code>w</code>) must be a multiple of 8 bits.

The cursor is created in black and white according to the following:

* data=0, mask=1: white
* data=1, mask=1: black
* data=0, mask=0: transparent
* data=1, mask=0: inverted color if possible, black if not.

Cursors created with this function must be freed with [[SDL_FreeCursor]]().

If you want to have a color cursor, or create your cursor from an
[[SDL_Surface]], you should use [[SDL_CreateColorCursor]](). Alternately,
you can hide the cursor and draw your own as part of your game's rendering,
but it will be bound to the framerate.

Also, since SDL 2.0.0, [[SDL_CreateSystemCursor]]() is available, which
provides twelve readily available system cursors to pick from.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
