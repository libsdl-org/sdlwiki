# SDL_GetScancodeName

Get a human-readable name for a scancode.

## Syntax

```c
const char* SDL_GetScancodeName(SDL_Scancode scancode);

```

## Function Parameters

|                  |                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **scancode**     | the desired [SDL_Scancode](SDL_Scancode.md) to query |

## Return Value

Returns a pointer to the name for the scancode. If the scancode doesn't
have a name this function returns an empty string ("").

## Remarks

See [SDL_Scancode](SDL_Scancode.md) for details.

**Warning**: The returned name is by design not stable across platforms,
e.g. the name for [`SDL_SCANCODE_LGUI`](SDL_SCANCODE_LGUI) is "Left GUI"
under Linux but "Left Windows" under Microsoft Windows, and some scancodes
like [`SDL_SCANCODE_NONUSBACKSLASH`](SDL_SCANCODE_NONUSBACKSLASH) don't
have any name at all. There are even scancodes that share names, e.g.
[`SDL_SCANCODE_RETURN`](SDL_SCANCODE_RETURN) and
[`SDL_SCANCODE_RETURN2`](SDL_SCANCODE_RETURN2) (both called "Return"). This
function is therefore unsuitable for creating a stable cross-platform
two-way mapping between strings and scancodes.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
