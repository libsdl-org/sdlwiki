= SDL_RenderGetMetalCommandEncoder =

Get the Metal command encoder for the current frame 

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void* SDL_RenderGetMetalCommandEncoder(SDL_Renderer * renderer);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''renderer'''
|The renderer to query
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns an <code>id<MTLRenderCommandEncoder></code> on success, or NULL if
the renderer isn't a Metal renderer or there was an error.

== Remarks ==

This function returns <code>void *</code>, so SDL doesn't have to include
Metal's headers, but it can be safely cast to an
<code>id<MTLRenderCommandEncoder></code>.

Note that as of SDL 2.0.18, this will return NULL if Metal refuses to give
SDL a drawable to render to, which might happen if the window is
hidden/minimized/offscreen. This doesn't apply to command encoders for
render targets, just the window's backbacker. Check your return values!

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.8.
