= SDL_HINT_RENDER_LINE_METHOD =

A variable controlling how the 2D render API renders lines.


== Values ==
{|
|0
|Use the default line drawing method (Bresenham's line algorithm as of SDL 2.0.20)
|-
|1
|Use the driver point API using Bresenham's line algorithm (correct, draws many points)
|-
|2
|Use the driver line API (occasionally misses line endpoints based on hardware driver quirks, was the default before 2.0.20)
|-
|3
|Use the driver geometry API (correct, draws thicker diagonal lines)
|}

== Remarks ==
This variable should be set when the renderer is created.
