====== (This is the legacy documentation for stable SDL2, the current stable version; [https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/ SDL3] is the current development version.) ======
= SDL_Quit =

Clean up all initialized subsystems.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_Quit(void);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

You should call this function even if you have already shutdown each
initialized subsystem with [[SDL_QuitSubSystem]](). It is safe to call this
function even in the case of errors in initialization.

If you start a subsystem using a call to that subsystem's init function
(for example [[SDL_VideoInit]]()) instead of [[SDL_Init]]() or
[[SDL_InitSubSystem]](), then you must use that subsystem's quit function
([[SDL_VideoQuit]]()) to shut it down before calling [[SDL_Quit]](). But
generally, you should not be using those functions directly anyhow; use
[[SDL_Init]]() instead.

Previous versions of this article have suggested registering [[SDL_Quit]]() with atexit() or similar APIs. Do not do this; crashes are likely to result.
== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
