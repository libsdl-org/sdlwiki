# SDL_Keycode

The SDL virtual key representation.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_keycode.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_keycode.h)

## Syntax

```c
typedef Sint32 SDL_Keycode;

#define SDLK_SCANCODE_MASK (1<<30)
#define SDL_SCANCODE_TO_KEYCODE(X)  (X | SDLK_SCANCODE_MASK)
```

## Remarks

Values of this type are used to represent keyboard keys using the current
layout of the keyboard. These values include Unicode values representing
the unmodified character that would be generated by pressing the key, or an
SDLK_* constant for those keys that do not generate characters.

A special exception is the number keys at the top of the keyboard which map
to [SDLK_0](SDLK_0)...[SDLK_9](SDLK_9) on AZERTY layouts.

The actual values that might be set for this type are listed in the
[SDL_KeyCode](SDL_KeyCode) (capital C) enumeration.
