====== (This is the legacy documentation for stable SDL2, the current stable version; [https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/ SDL3] is the current development version.) ======
= SDL_BlitSurface =

Performs a fast blit from the source surface to the destination surface.

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_surface.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_surface.h), but apps should _only_ `#include "SDL.h"`!

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
#define SDL_BlitSurface SDL_UpperBlit</syntaxhighlight>

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 if the blit is successful, otherwise it returns -1.

The blit function should not be called on a locked surface.

The blit semantics for surfaces with and without blending and colorkey are
defined as follows:

== Remarks ==

This assumes that the source and destination rectangles are the same size.
If either \c srcrect or \c dstrect are NULL, the entire surface (\c src or

== Code Examples ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
extern SDL_Surface *surface;
extern SDL_Rect source_rect;
SDL_Surface *temp_surface;
     
SDL_BlitSurface(surface, &source_rect, temp_surface, NULL);
</syntaxhighlight>
