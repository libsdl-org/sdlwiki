# SDL_Vulkan_GetInstanceExtensions

Get the names of the Vulkan instance extensions needed to create a surface with [SDL_Vulkan_CreateSurface](SDL_Vulkan_CreateSurface.md).

## Syntax

```c
SDL_bool SDL_Vulkan_GetInstanceExtensions(SDL_Window *window,
                                          unsigned int *pCount,
                                          const char **pNames);

```

## Function Parameters

|                |                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **window**     | A window for which the required Vulkan instance extensions should be retrieved (will be deprecated in a future release) |
| **pCount**     | A pointer to an unsigned int corresponding to the number of extensions to be returned                                   |
| **pNames**     | NULL or a pointer to an array to be filled with required Vulkan instance extensions                                     |

## Return Value

Returns [SDL_TRUE](SDL_TRUE.md) on success, [SDL_FALSE](SDL_FALSE.md) on error.

## Remarks

If `pNames` is NULL, then the number of required Vulkan instance extensions
is returned in `pCount`. Otherwise, `pCount` must point to a variable set
to the number of elements in the `pNames` array, and on return the variable
is overwritten with the number of names actually written to `pNames`. If
`pCount` is less than the number of required extensions, at most `pCount`
structures will be written. If `pCount` is smaller than the number of
required extensions, [SDL_FALSE](SDL_FALSE.md) will be returned instead of
[SDL_TRUE](SDL_TRUE.md), to indicate that not all the required extensions were
returned.

The `window` parameter is currently needed to be valid as of SDL 2.0.8,
however, this parameter will likely be removed in future releases

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.6.
