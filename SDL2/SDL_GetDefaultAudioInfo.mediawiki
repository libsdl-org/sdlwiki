= SDL_GetDefaultAudioInfo =

Get the name and preferred format of the default audio device.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_GetDefaultAudioInfo(char **name,
                            SDL_AudioSpec *spec,
                            int iscapture);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''name'''
|A pointer to be filled with the name of the default device (can be NULL). Please call [[SDL_free]]() when you are done with this pointer!
|-
|'''spec'''
|The [[SDL_AudioSpec]] to be initialized by this function.
|-
|'''iscapture'''
|non-zero to query the default recording device, zero to query the default output device.
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success, nonzero on error

== Remarks ==

Some (but not all!) platforms have an isolated mechanism to get information
about the "default" device. This can actually be a completely different
device that's not in the list you get from [[SDL_GetAudioDeviceSpec]](). It
can even be a network address! (This is discussed in
[[SDL_OpenAudioDevice]]().)

As a result, this call is not guaranteed to be performant, as it can query
the sound server directly every time, unlike the other query functions. You
should call this function sparingly!

<code>spec</code> will be filled with the sample rate, sample format, and
channel count, if a default device exists on the system. If
<code>name</code> is provided, will be filled with either a
dynamically-allocated UTF-8 string or NULL.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.24.0.
