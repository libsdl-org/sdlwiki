# SDL_hid_get_feature_report

Get a feature report from a HID device.

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_hid_get_feature_report(SDL_hid_device *dev, unsigned char *data, size_t length);

```

## Function Parameters

|                |                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **dev**        | A device handle returned from [SDL_hid_open](SDL_hid_open.md)().                                                                                                                                        |
| **data**       | A buffer to put the read data into, including the Report ID. Set the first byte of `data` to the Report ID of the report to be read, or set it to zero if your device does not use numbered reports. |
| **length**     | The number of bytes to read, including an extra byte for the report ID. The buffer can be longer than the actual report.                                                                             |

## Return Value

Returns the number of bytes read plus one for the report ID (which is still
in the first byte), or -1 on error.

## Remarks

Set the first byte of `data` to the Report ID of the report to be read.
Make sure to allow space for this extra byte in `data`. Upon return, the
first byte will still contain the Report ID, and the report data will start
in data[1].

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.18.
