====== (This is the legacy documentation for stable SDL2, the current stable version; [https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/ SDL3] is the current development version.) ======
= SDL_LoadBMP =

Load a surface from a file.

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_surface.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_surface.h), but apps should _only_ `#include "SDL.h"`!

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
#define SDL_LoadBMP(file)   SDL_LoadBMP_RW(SDL_RWFromFile(file, "rb"), 1)</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

Convenience macro.

== Code Examples ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
const char *image_path = "myimage.bmp";
SDL_Surface *image = SDL_LoadBMP(image_path);

/* Let the user know if the file failed to load */
if (!image) {
    printf("Failed to load image at %s: %s\n", image_path, SDL_GetError());
    return 1;
}

/* Do something with image here. */

/* Make sure to eventually release the surface resource */
SDL_FreeSurface(image);
</syntaxhighlight>
