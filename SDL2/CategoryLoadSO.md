# CategoryLoadSO

System-dependent library loading routines.

Some things to keep in mind:

- These functions only work on C function names. Other languages may have
  name mangling and intrinsic language support that varies from compiler to
  compiler.
- Make sure you declare your function pointers with the same calling
  convention as the actual library function. Your code will crash
  mysteriously if you do not do this.
- Avoid namespace collisions. If you load a symbol from the library, it is
  not defined whether or not it goes into the global symbol namespace for
  the application. If it does and it conflicts with symbols in your code or
  other shared libraries, you will not get the results you expect. :)
