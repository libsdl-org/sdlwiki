= SDL_UnlockTexture =

Unlock a texture, uploading the changes to video memory, if needed.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_UnlockTexture(SDL_Texture * texture);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''texture'''
|a texture locked by [[SDL_LockTexture]]()
|}

== Remarks ==

'''Warning''': Please note that [[SDL_LockTexture]]() is intended to be
write-only; it will not guarantee the previous contents of the texture will
be provided. You must fully initialize any area of a texture that you lock
before unlocking it, as the pixels might otherwise be uninitialized memory.

Which is to say: locking and immediately unlocking a texture can result in
corrupted textures, depending on the renderer in use.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
