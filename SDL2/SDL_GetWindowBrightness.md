# SDL_GetWindowBrightness

Get the brightness (gamma multiplier) for a given window's display.

## Syntax

```c
float SDL_GetWindowBrightness(SDL_Window * window);

```

## Function Parameters

|                |                                                                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **window**     | the window used to select the display whose brightness will be queried |

## Return Value

Returns the brightness for the display where 0.0 is completely dark and 1.0
is normal brightness.

## Remarks

Despite the name and signature, this method retrieves the brightness of the
entire display, not an individual window. A window is considered to be
owned by the display that contains the window's center pixel. (The index of
this display can be retrieved using
[SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex](SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex.md)().)

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
