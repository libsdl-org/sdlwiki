= SDL_BuildAudioCVT =

Initialize an [[SDL_AudioCVT]] structure for conversion.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_BuildAudioCVT(SDL_AudioCVT * cvt,
                      SDL_AudioFormat src_format,
                      Uint8 src_channels,
                      int src_rate,
                      SDL_AudioFormat dst_format,
                      Uint8 dst_channels,
                      int dst_rate);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''cvt'''
|an [[SDL_AudioCVT]] structure filled in with audio conversion information
|-
|'''src_format'''
|the source format of the audio data; for more info see [[SDL_AudioFormat]]
|-
|'''src_channels'''
|the number of channels in the source
|-
|'''src_rate'''
|the frequency (sample-frames-per-second) of the source
|-
|'''dst_format'''
|the destination format of the audio data; for more info see [[SDL_AudioFormat]]
|-
|'''dst_channels'''
|the number of channels in the destination
|-
|'''dst_rate'''
|the frequency (sample-frames-per-second) of the destination
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 1 if the audio filter is prepared, 0 if no conversion is needed, or
a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more
information.

== Remarks ==

Before an [[SDL_AudioCVT]] structure can be used to convert audio data it
must be initialized with source and destination information.

This function will zero out every field of the [[SDL_AudioCVT]], so it must
be called before the application fills in the final buffer information.

Once this function has returned successfully, and reported that a
conversion is necessary, the application fills in the rest of the fields in
[[SDL_AudioCVT]], now that it knows how large a buffer it needs to
allocate, and then can call [[SDL_ConvertAudio]]() to complete the
conversion.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
