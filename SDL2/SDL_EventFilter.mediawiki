====== (This is the legacy documentation for stable SDL2, the current stable version; [https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/ SDL3] is the current development version.) ======
= SDL_EventFilter =

A function pointer used for callbacks that watch the event queue.

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_events.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_events.h), but apps should _only_ `#include "SDL.h"`!

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
typedef int (SDLCALL * SDL_EventFilter) (void *userdata, SDL_Event * event);</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''userdata'''
|what was passed as <code>userdata</code> to [[SDL_SetEventFilter]]() or [[SDL_AddEventWatch]], etc
|-
|'''event'''
|the event that triggered the callback
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 1 to permit event to be added to the queue, and 0 to disallow it.
When used with [[SDL_AddEventWatch]], the return value is ignored.

== Code Examples ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int MyEventFunction(void *userdata, SDL_Event *event) {
    // Do things with userdata and event

    return 0; // Value will be ignored
}

// ...
SDL_AddEventWatch(MyEventFunction, NULL);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Definition Parameters ==

{|
|'''userdata'''
|The data passed by the original call to [[SDL_AddEventWatch]]
|-
|'''event'''
|The [[SDL_Event]] representing the event
|}
