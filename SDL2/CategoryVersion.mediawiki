== Introduction ==

These functions are used to collect or display information about the version of SDL that is currently being used by the program or that it was compiled against.

: The version consists of three segments (X.Y.Z)
* X = '''Major Version''', which increments with massive changes, additions, and enhancements
* Y = '''Minor Version''', which increments with backwards-compatible changes to the major revision
* Z = '''Patchlevel''', which increments with fixes to the minor revision<br/>
 ''Example:'' The first version of SDL 2 was 2.0.0

: The version may also be reported as a 4-digit numeric value where the thousands place represents the major version, the hundreds place represents the minor version, and the tens and ones places represent the patchlevel (update version).
 ''Example:'' The first version number of SDL 2 was 2000

SDL_revision.h must be included in your program explicitly if you want to use the SDL_REVISION constant.
