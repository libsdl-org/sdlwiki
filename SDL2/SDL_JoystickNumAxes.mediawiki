Get the number of general axis controls on a joystick.

|}

Returns the number of axis controls/number of axes on success or a negative
error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

Often, the directional pad on a game controller will either look like 4
separate buttons or a POV hat, and not axes, but all of this is up to the
device and platform.
