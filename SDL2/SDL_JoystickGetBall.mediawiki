</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''joystick'''
|the [[SDL_Joystick]] to query

|-
|'''dx'''
|stores the difference in the x axis position since the last poll

|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

Trackballs can only return relative motion since the last call to

Most joysticks do not have trackballs.
