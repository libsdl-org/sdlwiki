====== (This is the legacy documentation for stable SDL2, the current stable version; SDL3 is the current development version.) ======
= SDL_GetVersion =

Get the version of SDL that is linked against your program.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_GetVersion(SDL_version * ver);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''ver'''
|the [[SDL_version]] structure that contains the version information
|}

== Remarks ==

If you are linking to SDL dynamically, then it is possible that the current
version will be different than the version you compiled against. This
function returns the current version, while [[SDL_VERSION]]() is a macro
that tells you what version you compiled with.

This function may be called safely at any time, even before [[SDL_Init]]().

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
