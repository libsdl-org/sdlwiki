====== (This is the legacy documentation for stable SDL2, the current stable version; SDL3 is the current development version.) ======
= SDL_AndroidGetActivity =

Retrieve the Java instance of the Android activity class.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void * SDL_AndroidGetActivity(void);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Return Value ==

Returns the jobject representing the instance of the Activity class of the
Android application, or NULL on error.

== Remarks ==

The prototype of the function in SDL's code actually declares a void*
return type, even if the implementation returns a jobject. The rationale
being that the SDL headers can avoid including jni.h.

The jobject returned by the function is a local reference and must be
released by the caller. See the PushLocalFrame() and PopLocalFrame() or
DeleteLocalRef() functions of the Java native interface:

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
