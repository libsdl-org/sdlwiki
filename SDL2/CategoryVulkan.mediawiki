== Introduction ==

This category contains functions for creating a Vulkan instance with the required Vulkan extensions for surface creation.

The general flow of a Vulkan backed SDL application will be the following:

# Create your SDL window with the SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN flag.
# If necessary, use [[SDL_Vulkan_LoadLibrary]] and [[SDL_Vulkan_GetVkInstanceProcAddr]] to load the Vulkan library and query for driver function pointers (after initializing the video subsystem)
# Query for required extensions using [[SDL_Vulkan_GetInstanceExtensions]] and use this information to create a ```VkInstance```
# Create a surface for the window to draw on using [[SDL_Vulkan_CreateSurface]]
# When setting up pipelines and framebuffers for your newly created surface, use [[SDL_Vulkan_GetDrawableSize]] to query the surface extent
