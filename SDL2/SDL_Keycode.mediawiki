= SDL_Keycode =

The SDL virtual key representation.

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_keycode.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_keycode.h), but apps should _only_ `#include "SDL.h"`!

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
typedef Sint32 SDL_Keycode;</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

Values of this type are used to represent keyboard keys using the current
layout of the keyboard. These values include Unicode values representing
the unmodified character that would be generated by pressing the key, or an
SDLK_* constant for those keys that do not generate characters.

A special exception is the number keys at the top of the keyboard which map
to [[SDLK_0]]...[[SDLK_9]] on AZERTY layouts.

== Code Examples ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
  //checks if a key is being remapped and prints what the remapping is
  if(event->key.keysym.scancode != SDL_GetScancodeFromKey(event->key.keysym.sym))
    printf("Physical %s key acting as %s key",
      SDL_GetScancodeName(event->key.keysym.scancode),
      SDL_GetKeyName(event->key.keysym.sym));
</syntaxhighlight>
