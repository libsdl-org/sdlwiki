# SDL_UpdateYUVTexture

Update a rectangle within a planar YV12 or IYUV texture with new pixel data.

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_UpdateYUVTexture(SDL_Texture * texture,
                         const SDL_Rect * rect,
                         const Uint8 *Yplane, int Ypitch,
                         const Uint8 *Uplane, int Upitch,
                         const Uint8 *Vplane, int Vpitch);

```

## Function Parameters

|                 |                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **texture**     | the texture to update                                                                |
| **rect**        | a pointer to the rectangle of pixels to update, or NULL to update the entire texture |
| **Yplane**      | the raw pixel data for the Y plane                                                   |
| **Ypitch**      | the number of bytes between rows of pixel data for the Y plane                       |
| **Uplane**      | the raw pixel data for the U plane                                                   |
| **Upitch**      | the number of bytes between rows of pixel data for the U plane                       |
| **Vplane**      | the raw pixel data for the V plane                                                   |
| **Vpitch**      | the number of bytes between rows of pixel data for the V plane                       |

## Return Value

Returns 0 on success or -1 if the texture is not valid; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError.md)() for more information.

## Remarks

You can use [SDL_UpdateTexture](SDL_UpdateTexture.md)() as long as your pixel
data is a contiguous block of Y and U/V planes in the proper order, but
this function is available if your pixel data is not contiguous.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.1.
