= SDL_EncloseFPoints =

Calculate a minimal rectangle enclosing a set of points with float precision.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
SDL_bool SDL_EncloseFPoints(const SDL_FPoint * points,
                            int count,
                            const SDL_FRect * clip,
                            SDL_FRect * result);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''points'''
|an array of [[SDL_FPoint]] structures representing points to be enclosed
|-
|'''count'''
|the number of structures in the <code>points</code> array
|-
|'''clip'''
|an [[SDL_FRect]] used for clipping or NULL to enclose all points
|-
|'''result'''
|an [[SDL_FRect]] structure filled in with the minimal enclosing rectangle
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns [[SDL_TRUE]] if any points were enclosed or [[SDL_FALSE]] if all
the points were outside of the clipping rectangle.

== Remarks ==

If <code>clip</code> is not NULL then only points inside of the clipping
rectangle are considered.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.22.
