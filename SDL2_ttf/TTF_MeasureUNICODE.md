# TTF_MeasureUNICODE

Calculate how much of a UCS-2 string will fit in a given width.

## Syntax

```c
int TTF_MeasureUNICODE(TTF_Font *font, const Uint16 *text, int measure_width, int *extent, int *count);

```

## Function Parameters

|                       |                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **font**              | the font to query.                                                |
| **text**              | text to calculate, in UCS-2 encoding.                             |
| **measure_width**     | maximum width, in pixels, available for the string.               |
| **count**             | on return, filled with number of characters that can be rendered. |
| **extent**            | on return, filled with latest calculated width.                   |

## Return Value

Returns 0 if successful, -1 on error.

## Remarks

This reports the number of characters that can be rendered before reaching
`measure_width`.

This does not need to render the string to do this calculation.

Please note that this function is named "Unicode" but currently expects
UCS-2 encoding (16 bits per codepoint). This does not give you access to
large Unicode values, such as emoji glyphs. These codepoints are accessible
through the UTF-8 version of this function.

## Version

This function is available since SDL_ttf 2.0.18.
