###### (This function is part of SDL_ttf, a separate library from SDL.)
# TTF_GlyphMetrics

Query the metrics (dimensions) of a font's 16-bit glyph.

## Syntax

```c
int TTF_GlyphMetrics(TTF_Font *font, Uint16 ch,
int *minx, int *maxx,
int *miny, int *maxy, int *advance);

```

## Function Parameters

|              |                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **font**     | the font to query.           |
| **ch**       | the character code to check. |

## Remarks

To understand what these metrics mean, here is a useful link:

Note that this version of the function takes a 16-bit character code, which
covers the Basic Multilingual Plane, but is insufficient to cover the
entire set of possible Unicode values, including emoji glyphs. You should
use [TTF_GlyphMetrics32](TTF_GlyphMetrics32.md)() instead, which offers the
same functionality but takes a 32-bit codepoint instead.

The only reason to use this function is that it was available since the
beginning of time, more or less.

## Version

This function is available since SDL_ttf 2.0.12.
