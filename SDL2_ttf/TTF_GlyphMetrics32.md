###### (This function is part of SDL_ttf, a separate library from SDL.)
# TTF_GlyphMetrics32

Query the metrics (dimensions) of a font's 32-bit glyph.

## Syntax

```c
int TTF_GlyphMetrics32(TTF_Font *font, Uint32 ch,
int *minx, int *maxx,
int *miny, int *maxy, int *advance);

```

## Function Parameters

|              |                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **font**     | the font to query.           |
| **ch**       | the character code to check. |

## Remarks

To understand what these metrics mean, here is a useful link:

https://freetype.sourceforge.net/freetype2/docs/tutorial/step2.html

This is the same as [TTF_GlyphMetrics](TTF_GlyphMetrics.md)(), but takes a
32-bit character instead of 16-bit, and thus can query a larger range. If
you are sure you'll have an SDL_ttf that's version 2.0.18 or newer, there's
no reason not to use this function exclusively.

## Version

This function is available since SDL_ttf 2.0.18.
