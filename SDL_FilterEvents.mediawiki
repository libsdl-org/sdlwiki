====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! SDL2 is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_FilterEvents =

Run a specific filter function on the current event queue, removing any events for which the filter returns 0.

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_FilterEvents(SDL_EventFilter filter,
                      void *userdata);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''filter'''
|the [[SDL_EventFilter]] function to call when an event happens
|-
