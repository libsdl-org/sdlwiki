'''Include File(s):''' [http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/file/default/include/SDL_hints.h SDL_hints.h]


== Introduction ==
This category contains functions to set and get configuration hints, as well as listing each of them alphabetically.

The convention for naming hints is SDL_HINT_X, where "SDL_X" is the environment variable that can be used to override the default.

In general these hints are just that - they may or may not be supported or applicable on any given platform, but they provide a way for an application or user to give the library a hint as to how they would like the library to work.
