= SDL_AudioStream =
An opaque structure that buffers, converts, resamples, and generally streams audio data.


== Remarks ==
The [[SDL_AudioStream]] structure is used to convert audio data between different formats in arbitrarily-sized blocks. It is meant to be a replacement for the [[SDL_AudioCVT]]-related interfaces.

A tutorial on using SDL_AudioStream is at [[Tutorials/AudioStream]].

(this page should be fleshed out more, too.)
