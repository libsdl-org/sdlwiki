= SDL_LoadBMP_RW =

Load a BMP image from a seekable SDL data stream.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
SDL_Surface* SDL_LoadBMP_RW(SDL_RWops *src,
                            int freesrc);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''src'''
|the data stream for the surface
|-
|'''freesrc'''
|non-zero to close the stream after being read
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns a pointer to a new [[SDL_Surface]] structure or NULL if there was
an error; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

The new surface should be freed with [[SDL_FreeSurface]](). Not doing so will
result in a memory leak.

src is an open SDL_RWops buffer, typically loaded with [[SDL_RWFromFile]].
Alternitavely, you might also use the macro [[SDL_LoadBMP]] to load a bitmap
from a file, convert it to an SDL_Surface and then close the file.

=== Code Example ===

<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
const char *image_path = "myimage.bmp";

/* "rb" will "read binary" files */
SDL_RWops *file = SDL_RWFromFile(image_path, "rb");

/* freesrc is true so the file automatically closes */
SDL_Surface *image = SDL_LoadBMP_RW(file, SDL_TRUE);

/* Let the user know if the file failed to load */
if (!image) {
    printf("Failed to load image at %s: %s\n", image_path, SDL_GetError());
    return;
}

/* Do something with image here. */

/* Make sure to eventually release the surface resource */
SDL_FreeSurface(image);
</syntaxhighlight>
